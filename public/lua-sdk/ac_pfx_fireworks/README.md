# Module common/common.lua

## Class ac.GenericList
FFI-accelerated list, acts like a regular list (consequent items, size and capacity, automatically growing, etc.)
Doesn’t store nil values to act more like a Lua table.

Few notes:
• Use `:get()` and `:set()` to access elements instead of square brakets;
• Indices are 1-based;
• For fastest access to individual elements use `.raw` field: it’s a raw pointer, so use 0-based indices there and
make sure not to access things outside of list size.

For slightly better performance it might be benefitial to preallocate memory with `list:reserve(expectedSizeOrABitMore)`.

- `ac.GenericList:get(index)`

  Return an element at given index.

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

  Returns:

    - `any`

- `ac.GenericList:set(index, value)`

  Sets an element at given index.

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

    2. `value`: `any`

- `ac.GenericList:size()`

  Number of items in the list.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:sizeBytes()`

  Size of list in bytes (not capacity, for that use `list:capacityBytes()`).

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:isEmpty()`

  Checks if list is empty.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ac.GenericList:capacity()`

  Capacity of the list.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:capacityBytes()`

  Size of list in bytes (capacity).

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:reserve(newSize)`

  Makes sure list can fit `newSize` of elements without reallocating memory.

  Parameters:

    1. `newSize`: `integer`

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:shrinkToFit()`

  If capacity is greater than current size, reallocates a smaller bit of memory and moves data there.
function _ac_genericList:shrinkToFit() end

- `ac.GenericList:clear()`

  Removes all elements.
function _ac_genericList:clear() end

- `ac.GenericList:clone()`

  Creates a new list with the same contents as the existing one.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GenericList`
## Class ffilibex

## Function worker.sleep(time)
Available only in background worker scripts. Sleep function pauses execution for a certain time. 
Before unpaused, any callbacks (such as `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()` and
other custom enqueued callbacks) will be called. This is the only way for those callbacks to fire in a background worker. Note:
if parent thread is closed, `worker.sleep()` won’t return back and instead script will be unloaded, this way worker can be reloaded
as well.

If your worker does a lot of async operations, consider using `worker.wait()` instead, setting resulting value with `worker.result`.
Or maybe not even use anything at all: for basic (non-repeating) callbacks, timers and intervals script will continue running until
all the postponed actions are complete (updating once every 100 ms).

  Parameters:

  1. `time`: `number` Time in seconds to pause worker by.
## Function worker.wait(time)
Wait for `worker.result` value to be set. Stops the worker once `worker.result` value has been provided (or any `error()` has been raised).
Works the best if your worker uses a lot of async operations.

  Parameters:

  1. `time`: `number?` Time in seconds for timeout. Default value: 60. Feel free to pass something like `math.huge` if you don’t need timeout for some reason.
## Function ac.onRelease(callback, item)
Adds a callback which might be called when script is unloading. Use it for some state reversion, but
don’t rely on it too much. For example, if Assetto Corsa would crash or just close rapidly, it would not
be called. It should be called when scripts reload though.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(item: T)`

  2. `item`: `T?` Optional parameter. If provided, will be passed to callback on release, but stored with a weak reference, so it could still be GCed before that (in that case, callback won’t be called at all).

  Returns:

  - `fun`
## Function package.add(dir)
For easy import of scripts from subdirectories. Provide it a name of a directory relative
to main script folder and it would add that directory to paths it searches for.

  Parameters:

  1. `dir`: `string`
## Function ac.onOnlineWelcome(callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when server welcome message and extended config arrive.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(message: string, config: ac.INIConfig)` Callback function.

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`

# Module common/class.lua

## Function ClassBase.isInstanceOf(obj)
Checks if object is an instance of a class created by `class()` function.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `any|nil` Any table, vector, nil, anything.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if type of `obj` is `ClassBase` or any class inheriting from it.
## Function ClassBase:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)
Checks if ClassBase is a subsclass of a class created by `class()` function. It wouldn’t be, function is here just for
keeping things even.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` Always false.
## Function ClassBase:subclass(...)
Creates a new class. Pretty much the same as calling `class()` (all classes are inheriting from `ClassBase` anyway).

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function ClassBase:include(mixin)
Adds a mixin to all subsequently created classes. Use it early in case you want to add a method or some data to all of your objects.
If `mixin` has a property `included`, it would be called each time new class is created with a reference to the newly created class.

  Parameters:

  1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin`
## Function ClassBase:subclassed(classDefinition)
Define this function and it would be called each time a new class without a parent (or `ClassBase` for parent) is created.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition`
## Function ClassPool.isInstanceOf(obj)
Checks if object is an instance of a class with pooling active.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `any|nil` Any table, vector, nil, anything.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if type of `obj` is `ClassPool` or any class inheriting from it.
## Function ClassPool:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)
Checks if ClassPool is a subsclass of a class created by `class()` function. It wouldn’t be unless you’re passing `ClassBase`, function is here just for
keeping things even.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassBase` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if you’ve passed ClassBase here.
## Function ClassPool:subclass(...)
Creates a new class with pooling. Pretty much the same as calling `class(class.Pool, ...)` (all classes with `class.Pool` are 
inheriting from `ClassPool` anyway).

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function ClassPool:include(mixin)
Adds a mixin to subsequently created classes with pooling. Use it early in case you want to add a method or some data to all of your objects that use pooling.
If `mixin` has a property `included`, it would be called each time new class with pooling is created with a reference to the newly created class.

  Parameters:

  1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin`
## Function ClassPool:subclassed(classDefinition)
Define this function and it would be called each time a new pooling class without a parent (or `ClassPool` for parent) is created.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition`
## Class ClassBase
A base class. Note: all classes are inheriting from this one even if they’re not using
`ClassBase` as a parent class explicitly. You might still want to put it in EmmyDoc comment to get hints for functions like `YourClass.isInstanceOf()`.

- `ClassBase:isInstanceOf(classDefinition)`

  Checks if object is an instance of this class. Can be used either as `obj:isInstanceOf(YourClass)` or, as a safer alternative,
`YourClass.isInstanceOf(obj)` — this one would work even if `obj` is nil, a number, a vector, anything like that. And in all of those
cases, of course, it would return `false`.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Used with `obj:isInstanceOf(YourClass)` variant.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` True if argument is an instance of this class.

- `ClassBase:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)`

  Class method. Checks if class itself is a child class of a different class (or a child of a child, etc). 
Can be used as `YourClass:isInstanceOf(YourOtherClass)`.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` True if this class is a child of another class (or a child of a child, etc).

- `ClassBase:include(mixin)`

  Class method. Includes mixin, adding new methods to a preexising class. If mixin has a property `included`, it will be called
with an argument referencing a class mixin is being added to. Can be used as `YourClass:include({ newMethod = function(self, arg) end })`.

  Parameters:

    1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin` Any mixin.

- `ClassBase:subclass(...)`

  Class method. Creates a new child class.

  Returns:

    - `ClassDefinition` New class definition

- `ClassBase:subclassed(classDefinition)`

  Class method. Called when a new child class is created using this class as a parent one. Redefine this function for
your class if you need some advanced processing, like adding new methods to a child class.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Class ClassPool
A base class for objects with pooling. Doesn’t add anything, but you can add it as a parent class
so that `recycled()` would be documented.

- `ClassPool:recycled()`

  Called when object is about to get recycled.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` Return false if this object should not be recycled and instead destroyed as usual.
## Function class(name, parentClass, flags)
Create a new class. Example:

```lua
local MyClass = class('MyClass')        -- class declaration

function MyClass:initialize(arg1, arg2) -- constructor
  self.myField = arg1 + arg2            -- field
end

function MyClass:doMyThing()            -- method
  print(self.myField)
end

local instance = MyClass(1, 2)          -- creating instance of a class
instance:doMyThing()                    -- calling a method
```

Whole thing is very similar to [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass), but it’s a different
implementation that should be somewhat faster. Main differences:

1. Class name is stored in `YourClass.__name` instead of `YourClass.name`.

2. There is no `.static` subtable, all static fields and methods are instead stored in main class
   table and thus are available as instance fields and methods as well (that’s why `YourClass.name` was
   renamed to `YourClass.__name`, to avoid possible confusion with a common field name). It’s a bit
   messier, especially with class methods such as `:subclass()`, but it has some advantages as well:
   objects creation is faster, and it’s more EmmyLua-friendly (both of which is what it’s all about).

3. Overloaded `__tostring`, `__len` and `__call` are inherited, but not other operators.

4. Method `YourClass.allocate()` works differently here and is used to create a simple table which will be
   passed to `setmetatable()`. This can help with performance if objects are created often.

Everything else should work the same, including inheritance and mixins. As for performance, some simple
tests show up to 30% faster objects creation and 40% less memory used for objects with two fields when
using `YourClass.allocate()` method instead of `YourClass:initialize()` (that alone gives about 15% increase in speed
when creating an object with two fields):

```lua
function YourClass.allocate(arg1, arg2)  -- notice . instead of :
  return { myField = arg1 + arg2 }     -- also notice, methods are not available at this stage
end
```

Other differences (new features rather than something breaking compatibility) and important notes:

1. Function `class()` takes string for class name, another class to act like a parent,
   allocate and initialize functions and flags. Everything is optional and can go in any order (with one caveat:
   allocate function should go before initialize function unless you’re using `class.Pool`). Generally there is no
   benefit in passing allocate and initialize functions here though.

2. With flag `class.NoInitialize` constructor would not look for `YourClass:initialize()` method to call at all,
   instead using only `YourClass.allocate()`. Might speed things up a bit further.

3. If you’re creating new instances really often, there is a `class.Pool` flag. It would disable the use of
   `YourClass.allocate()`, but instead allow to reuse unused objects by using `class.recycle(object)`. Recycled objects
   would end up in a pool of objects to be reused next time an instance would need to be created. Of course, it
   introduces a whole new type of errors (imagine storing a reference to a recycled item somewhere not knowing it was
   recycled and now represents something else entirely), so please be careful.

   Note 1: Method `class.recycle()` can be used with nils or non-recycle, no need to have extra checks before calling it.
 
   Note 2: Instances of child classes won’t end up in parent class pool. For such arrangements, consider adding pooling
           flag to all of child classes where appropriate.

4. Before recycling, method `YourClass:recycled()` will be called. Good time to recycle any inner elements. Also,
   return `false` from it and object would not be recycled at all.

5. To check type, `YourClass.isInstanceOf(item)` can also be used. Notice that it’s a static method, no “:” here.

All classes are considered children classes of `ClassBase`, that one is mostly for EmmyLua to pick up methods like 
`YourClass.isInstanceOf(object)`. If you’re creating your own class and want to use such methods, just add `: ClassBase`
to its EmmyLua annotation. And objects with pooling are children of `ClassPool` which is a child of `ClassBase`. Note: 
to speed things up, those classes aren’t fully real, but you can access them and their methods and even call things like
`ClassBase:include()`. Please read documentation for those functions before using them though, just to check.

  Parameters:

  1. `name`: `string` Class name.

  2. `parentClass`: `ClassBase` Parent class.

  3. `flags`: `nil|integer|`class.NoInitialize`|`class.Pool`|`class.Minimal`` Flags.

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function class.recycle(item)
Recycle an item to its pool, to speed up creation and reduce work for GC. Requires class to be created with
`class.Pool` flag.

This method has protection from double recycling, recycling nils or non-recycleable items, so don’t worry about it.

  Parameters:

  1. `item`: `ClassPool|nil`
## Function class.emmy(classFn, constructorFn) return constructorFn
A trick to get `class()` to work with EmmyLua annotations nicely. Call `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.initialize)`
or `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.allocate)` (whatever you’re using) and it would give you a constructor function.
Then, use it for local reference or as a return value from module. For best results add annotations to function you’re
passing here, such as return value or argument types.

In reality is simply returns the class back and ignores second argument, but because of this definition EmmyLua thinks
it got the constructor.

  1. `classFn`: `T1`

  2. `constructorFn`: `T2`

  Returns:

Sets a callback which will be called when AC resolution changes. Happens when window size changes, or when making a screenshot.
Note: some scripts, such as WeatherFX style or post-processing script, reload completely when resolution changes, but if they’d call
this function at any point, they would no longer reload. Instead CSP assumes they can handle resolution changes on their side.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(newSize: vec2, makingScreenshot: boolean)`

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function ac.onTyresSetChange(carIndex, callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when selected tyres change for some car. For car scripts to track changes in their own car, use `car.index` as first argument.
 Note: for physics scripts this even might come a few frames late, but it shouldn’t be a major issue since tyres changes only happen when car is stationary anyway.

  Parameters:

  1. `carIndex`: `integer` 0-based car index, or -1 for an event to be called for all cars.

  2. `callback`: `fun(carIndex: integer, setIndex: integer, shortName: string, longName: string)`

Extract files from a ZIP file into a given directory. Creates directory if it’s missing.
Not available to scripts without I/O access.

  Parameters:

  1. `zipFilename`: `binary?`

  2. `destination`: `path` Full path to target directory.

  3. `filter`: `nil|string|{filter: string?, crucial: string?}` Optional filter for full entry paths. Since 0.2.10, you can pass a table with a `crucial` param for an entry path of a crucial file: it’ll be extracted last with a temporary name, and renamed after everything is finished. You can later check the existence of this file to ensure ZIP has been unpacked entirely without any interruptions. If `crucial` param has been passed, but file wasn’t found, callback will report an error.

  4. `callback`: `fun(err: string?)`
## Function io.checksumSHA256(filename, callback)
Computes SHA-256 checksum of a given file, returns result in a callback.

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `path`

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, checksum: string)`
## Function io.scanZip(zipFilename)
Returns list of entry names from a ZIP-file.

  Parameters:

  1. `zipFilename`: `binary?`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function io.createZipAsync(filename, entries, callback)
Not available to scripts without I/O access.

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `path?` Pass `nil` to instead get the binary data in the callback.

  2. `entries`: `table<string, io.ZipEntry>` Keys store entry names (use “/” as separator for creating sub-folders), and values store either binary data or tables in `io.ZipEntry` format.

  3. `callback`: `fun(err: string?, response: binary?)` Callback will contain reference to binary data if `filename` is `nil`.
## Function os.preciseClock()
Returns time in seconds from script start (with high precision).

  Returns:

  - `number` Seconds.
## Function os.onURL(mask, callback, priority)
Sets a callback which will be called when CSP itself or a CSP Lua script tries to open an URL. Return `true` if you’re handling URL, so the event would be stopped.

  Parameters:

  1. `mask`: `string` Regular expression to check URLs against of.

  2. `callback`: `fun(url: string): boolean`

  3. `priority`: `integer?` Smaller values mean script would be the last to get URL (if other scripts wouldn’t intercept it). Default value: 0.

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function os.execute(cmd, timeoutMs, windowless)
Altered version of regular `os.execute()`: allows to specify timeout and doesn’t show a new window.
 Note: please consider using `os.runConsoleProcess()` instead: it’s a lot more robust, asynchronous and tweak-able.
Not available to scripts without I/O access.

  Parameters:

  1. `cmd`: `string`

  2. `timeoutMs`: `integer?` Default value: -1.

  3. `windowless`: `boolean?` Default value: `true`.

  Returns:

  - `integer`
## Function os.setCurrentFolder(filename)
Changes current directory. Any argument `path`, when parsed and found not to be absolute, will be resolved against current directory.
By default, uses AC root folder. Any change only applies to the current script only. Current path resets when script is reloaded.

Changes behavior of images and assets lookup as well (by default it scans script folder, CSP folder and then root folder looking for a file,
which might cause some issues and negatively affect performance).

 For scripts without I/O access, only folders script can read from can be used here.

 Note: as of 0.2.6, some API functions might still use AC root folder. This will be fixed in the future, please do not rely on this behavior!

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `path`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function os.dateGlobal(format, timestamp)
Returns formatted date. Same as `os.date()`, but returned value does not include system timezome.

  Parameters:

  1. `format`: `string`

  2. `timestamp`: `integer`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function os.addDLLDirectory(filename)

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `string` If not absolute, considered to be relative to script root folder.
## Function os.showMessage(msg, type)
Show a popup message using good old MessageBox. Please do not use it for debugging, instead consider using `ac.log()` and `ac.debug('key', 'value')`
with in-game Lua Debug App.
Note: do not rely on this function, most likely it might be removed in the future as obstructing.

  Parameters:

  1. `msg`: `string`

  2. `type`: `integer?` Type of MessageBox according to WinAPI. Default value: 0.

# Module common/internal.lua

## Function setTimeout(callback, delay, uniqueKey)
Runs callback after certain time. Returns cancellation ID.
Note: all callbacks will be ran before `update()` call,
and they would only ran when script runs. So if your script is executed each frame and AC runs at 60 FPS, smallest interval
would be 0.016 s, and anything lower that you’d set would still act like 0.016 s. Also, intervals would only be called once
per frame.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun()`

  2. `delay`: `number?` Delay time in seconds. Default value: 0.

  3. `uniqueKey`: `any?` Unique key: if set, timer wouldn’t be added unless there is no more active timers with such ID.

  Returns:

  - `integer`
## Function setInterval(callback, period, uniqueKey)
Repeteadly runs callback after certain time. Returns cancellation ID.
Note: all callbacks will be ran before `update()` call,
and they would only ran when script runs. So if your script is executed each frame and AC runs at 60 FPS, smallest interval
would be 0.016 s, and anything lower that you’d set would still act like 0.016 s. Also, intervals would only be called once
per frame.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(): function?` Return `clearInterval` (actual function) to clear interval.

  2. `period`: `number?` Period time in seconds. Default value: 0.

  3. `uniqueKey`: `any?` Unique key: if set, timer wouldn’t be added unless there is no more active timers with such ID.

  Returns:

  - `integer`
## Function clearTimeout(cancellationID)
Stops timeout. If called with an ID from `setInterval`, works as well.

  Parameters:

  1. `cancellationID`: `integer` Value earlier retuned by `setTimeout()`. If a non-numerical value is passed (like a `nil`), call is ignored and returns `false`.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if timeout with such ID has been found and stopped.
## Function clearInterval(cancellationID)
Stops interval. Return this value from a callback to cancel out an interval.
If called with an ID from `setTimeout`, works as well.

  Parameters:

  1. `cancellationID`: `integer` Value earlier retuned by `setInterval()`. If a non-numerical value is passed (like a `nil`), call is ignored and returns `false`.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if interval with such ID has been found and stopped.

# Module common/io.lua

## Class io.FileAttributes
Structure containing various file or directory attributes, including various flags and dates. All values are precomputed and ready to be used (there is
no overhead in accessing them once you get the structure).
## Function io.scanDir(directory, mask, callback, callbackData)
Scan directory and call callback function for each of files, passing file name (not full name, but only name of the file) and attributes. If callback function would return
a non-nil value, iteration will stop and value returned by callback would return from this function. This could be used to
find a certain file without going through all files in the directory. Optionally, a mask can be used to pre-filter received files
entries.

If callback function is not provided, it’ll return list of files instead (file names only).

System entries “.” and “..” will not be included in the list of files. Accessing attributes does not add extra cost.

  Parameters:

  1. `directory`: `string` Directory to look for files in. Note: directory is relative to current directory, not to script directory. For AC in general it’s an AC root directory, but do not rely on it, instead use `ac.getFolder(ac.FolderID.Root)`.

  2. `mask`: `string?` Mask in a form of usual “*.*”. Default value: '*'.

  3. `callback`: `fun(fileName: string, fileAttributes: io.FileAttributes, callbackData: TCallbackData): TReturn?` Callback which will be ran for every file in directory fitting mask until it would return a non-nil value.

  4. `callbackData`: `TCallbackData?` Callback data that will be passed to callback as third argument, to avoid creating a capture.

  Returns:

  - `TReturn`

# Module common/ac_extras_connect.lua

## Function ac.connect(layout, keepLive, namespace)
Creates a new shared structure to quickly exchange data between different Lua scripts within a session. Example:
```lua
local sharedData = ac.connect{
  ac.StructItem.key('myChannel'),        -- optional, to avoid collisions
  someString = ac.StructItem.string(24), -- 24 is for capacity
  someInt = ac.StructItem.int(),
  someDouble = ac.StructItem.double(),
  someVec = ac.StructItem.vec3()
}
```

Note: to connect two scripts, both of them chould use `ac.connect()` and pass exactly the same layouts. Also, consider using more
specific names to avoid possible unwanted collisions. For example, instead of using `value = ac.StructItem.int()` which might be
used somewhere else, use `weatherBrightnessValue = ac.StructItem.int()`. Or, simply add `ac.StructItem.key('myUniqueKey')`.

For safety reasons, car scripts can only connect to other car scripts, and track scripts can only connect to other track scripts.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  2. `keepLive`: `boolean?` Set to true to keep structure even if any references were removed or script was unloaded.

  3. `namespace`: `nil|ac.SharedNamespace` Optional namespace stopping scripts of certain types to access data of scripts with different types. For more details check `ac.SharedNamespace` documentation.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ac.StructItem.combine(layout, compact)
Create a new struct from a given layout. Could be used in calls like `ac.structBytes()` and `ac.fillStructWithBytes()`. Each call defines and creates a new struct, so don’t
call them each frame, I believe LuaJIT doesn’t do garbage collection on struct definitions.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T`

  2. `compact`: `boolean?`

  Returns:

  1. `T`

  2. `integer` Structure size.

  3. `string` Structure name.

# Module common/ac_struct_item.lua

## Function ac.StructItem.key(key)
Adds a key to a structure to ensure its uniqueness. Consider using something like “yourUsername.yourContentID” or something
like that for a key, so that your data would not interfere with data from Lua scripts written by other developers. Note:
if you’re exchanging data between physics and graphics thread in your car, you might have to append `car.index` to there as
well so that different cars would have either own data things.

  Returns:

  - `nil`
## Function ac.StructItem.explicit(alignment, packing)
Enables explicit ordering for your structures.
By default, CSP will reorder fields in your structures for optimal data packing. Because all scripts written in Lua share the same algorithm,
it’s all fine and good, but if you want for your script to exchange data with other programs, explicit order would work much better.

  Parameters:

  1. `alignment`: `integer?` Optional override for alignment of child structures.

  2. `packing`: `integer?` Optional overrider for packing of fields.

  Returns:

  - `nil`
## Function ac.StructItem.half()

## Function ac.StructItem.mat3x3()

  Returns:

  - `mat3x3`
## Function ac.StructItem.mat4x4()

  Returns:

  - `mat4x4`
## Function ac.StructItem.transform(compactPosition, compactRotation, rangeFrom, rangeTo)
Matrix packed to 6, 9 or 12 bytes (depending on settings).

Note: to update value you need to use assignment operator (`.field = newValue`), altering matrix of this property with methods like
`:mulSelf()` only changes unpacked value on your side, but not the actual structure value.

  Parameters:

  1. `compactPosition`: `boolean?` If `true`, position is packed into 3 bytes, otherwise it will take 6 bytes. Default value: `false`.

  2. `compactRotation`: `boolean?` If `true`, rotation is packed into 3 bytes, otherwise it will take 6 bytes. Default value: `false`.

  3. `rangeFrom`: `number|vec3?` Minimal expected position. Pass it together with `rangeTo` to encode position data more efficiently.

  4. `rangeTo`: `number|vec3?` Maximum expected position. Pass it together with `rangeFrom` to encode position data more efficiently.

  Returns:

  - `mat4x4`
## Function ac.StructItem.build(layout)
Simply create a new FFI structure with a given layout. Doesn’t connect to anything.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  Returns:

  - `T`

# Module common/ac_extras_hashspace.lua

# Module common/ac_extras_numlut.lua

## Function ac.Lut(data, hsvColumns)

  2. `hsvColumns`: `integer[]` 1-based indices of columns storing HSV data. Such columns, of course, will be interpolated differently (for example, mixing hues 350 and 20 would produce 10).

  Returns:

  - `ac.Lut`
## Function ac.LutJit:new(o, data, hsvRows)
Creates new ac.LuaJit instance. Deprecated and broken, use `ac.Lut` instead.

  Parameters:

  2. `hsvRows`: `integer[]`  1-based indices of columns (not rows) storing HSV values in them.

  Returns:

  - `table`

# Module common/ac_extras_onlineevent.lua

## Function ac.OnlineEvent(layout, callback, namespace, udp, params)
Creates a new type of online event to exchange between scripts running on different clients in an online
race. Example:
```lua
local chatMessageEvent = ac.OnlineEvent({
  -- message structure layout:
  message = ac.StructItem.string(50),
  mood = ac.StructItem.float(),
}, function (sender, data)
  -- got a message from other client (or ourselves; in such case `sender.index` would be 0):
  ac.debug('Got message: from', sender and sender.index or -1)
  ac.debug('Got message: text', data.message)
  ac.debug('Got message: mood', data.mood)
end)

-- sending a new message:
chatMessageEvent{ message = 'hello world', mood = 5 }
```

Note: to exchange messages between two scripts, both of them chould use `ac.OnlineEvent()` and pass exactly the same layouts. Also, consider using more
specific names to avoid possible unwanted collisions. For example, instead of using `value = ac.StructItem.int()` which might be
used somewhere else, use `mySpecificValue = ac.StructItem.int()`. Or, simply add `ac.StructItem.key('myUniqueKey')`.

For safety reasons, car scripts can only exchange messages with other car scripts, and track scripts can only exchange messages with other track scripts.
Your own messages will arrive to you as well unless you were to use `target` with ID different from your session ID, you might need to filter out those
messages.

If the server is not a custom AC Server (use `ac.getSim().directMessagingAvailable` to check), but the original implementation, following restrictions apply:
- Each message should be smaller than 175 bytes.
- At least 200 ms should pass between sending messages.
- UDP messages are not available (those require `ac.getSim().directUDPMessagingAvailable` flag).
- Don’t use this system to exchange data too often: it uses chat messages to transfer data, so it’s far from optimal.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  2. `callback`: `fun(sender: ac.StateCar|nil, message: T)` Callback that will be called when a new message of this type is received. Note: it would be called even if message was sent from this script. Use `sender` to check message origin: if it’s `nil`, message has come from the server, if its `.index` is 0, message has come from this client (and possibly this script).

  3. `namespace`: `nil|ac.SharedNamespace` Optional namespace stopping scripts of certain types to access data of scripts with different types. For more details check `ac.SharedNamespace` documentation.

  4. `udp`: `nil|boolean|{range: number}` Pass `true` to use UDP messages (available for Lua apps and online scripts only). Use `ac.getSim().directUDPMessagingAvailable` to check if you could use `udp` flag before hand. Note: enabling this option means `repeatForNewConnections` parameter will be ignored. Alternatively, pass a table with advanced UDP settings.

  5. `params`: `{processPostponed: boolean?}?` Extra params. Set `processPostponed` to process previously received TCP messages (up to 256, callback will be called in the next frame for all messages from first to last).

  Returns:

  1. `fun`

  2. `fun`

# Module common/ac_extras_connectmmf.lua

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `string` Shared memory file filename (without “Local\” bit).

  2. `layout`: `T` String for the body of the structure.

  3. `persist`: `boolean?` Keep file alive even after the script stopped or the variable was cleared by garbage collector. Default value: `false`.

## Class ac.StoredValue

- `ac.StoredValue:get()`

  Returns:

    - `string|number|boolean|vec2|vec3|vec4|rgb|rgbm`

- `ac.StoredValue:set(value)`

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `string|number|boolean|vec2|vec3|vec4|rgb|rgbm`
## Function ac.storage(layout, keyPrefix)
Storage function. Easiest way to use is to pass it a table with default values — it would give you a table back
which would load values on reads and save values on writes. Values have to be either strings, numbers, booleans,
vectors or colors. Example:
```lua
local storedValues = ac.storage{
  someKey = 15,
  someStringValue = 20
}
storedValues.someKey = 20
```
Alternatively, you can use it as a function which would take a key and a default value and return you an
`ac.StoredValue` wrapper with methods `:get()` and `:set(newValue)`:
```lua
local stored = ac.storage('someKey', 15)
stored:get()
stored:set(20)
```
Or, just access it directly in `localStorage` style of JavaScript. Similar to JavaScript, this way you can only store
strings:
```lua
ac.storage.key = 'value'
ac.debug('loaded', ac.storage.key)
```
Data will be saved in “Documents\Assetto Corsa\cfg\extension\state\lua”, in corresponding subfolder. Actual writing
will happen a few seconds after new value was pushed, and only if value was changed, so feel free to use this function
to write things often.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T`

  2. `keyPrefix`: `string|nil` Optional parameter for adding a prefix to keys.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ac.storageHasKey(storage, key)

# Module common/ac_physics_unrestricted.lua



# Module common/stringify.lua

## Function stringify(obj, compact, depthLimit)
Serialize Lua value (table, number, string, etc.) in a Lua table format (similar to how `JSON.stringify` in JavaScript
generates a thing with JavaScript syntax). Format seems to be called Luaon. Most of Lua entities are supported, including array-like tables, table
tables and mixed ones. CSP API things, such as vectors or colors, are also supported. For things like threads,
functions or unknown cdata types instead a placeholder object will be created.

Circular references also result in creating similar objects, for example: `t = {1, 2, 3, t}` would result in
`{ 1, 2, 3, { type = 'circular reference' } }`.

If any table in given data would have a `__stringify()` function, it would be called as a method (so first argument
would be the table with `__stringify` itself). If that function would return a string, that string will be used
instead of regular table serialization. The idea is for classes to define a method like this and output a line of code
which could be used to create a new instance like this on deserialization. Note: for such like to use a custom function
like a class constructor, you would either need to register that function with a certain name or provide a table referring
to it on deserialization. That’s because although deserialization uses `load()` function to parse and run data as Lua code,
it wouldn’t allow code to access existing functions by default.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil` Object to serialize.

  2. `compact`: `boolean?` If true, resulting string would not have spaces and line breaks, slightly faster and a lot more compact.

  3. `depthLimit`: `integer?` Limits how deep serialization would go. Default value: 20.

  Returns:

  - `string` String with input data presented in Lua syntax.
## Function stringify.parse(serialized, namespace)
Parse a string with Lua table syntax into a Lua object (table, number, string, vector, etc.), can support custom objects as well.
Only functions from `namespace` can be used (as well as vectors and functions registered earlier with `stringify.register()`),
so if you’re using custom classes, make sure to either register them earlier or pass them in `namespace` table. Alternatively,
you can just pass `_G` as `namespace`, but it might be pretty unsecure, so maybe don’t do it.

Would raise an error if failed to parse or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string` Serialized data.

  2. `namespace`: `table|nil` Namespace table. Serialized data would be evaluated as Lua code and would have access to it.

  Returns:

  - `table|number|string|boolean|nil`
## Function stringify.tryParse(serialized, namespace, fallback)
Parse a string with Lua table syntax into a Lua object (table, number, string, vector, etc.), can support custom objects as well.
Only functions from `namespace` can be used (as well as vectors and functions registered earlier with `stringify.register()`),
so if you’re using custom classes, make sure to either register them earlier or pass them in `namespace` table. Alternatively,
you can just pass `_G` as `namespace`, but it might be pretty unsecure, so maybe don’t do it.

Returns fallback value if failed to parse, or if `serialized` is empty or not set, or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string?` Serialized data.

  2. `namespace`: `table|nil` Namespace table. Serialized data would be evaluated as Lua code and would have access to it.

  3. `fallback`: `T|nil` Value to return if parsing failed.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function stringify.register(name, fn)
Registers a new initializer function with a given name.

  Parameters:

  1. `name`: `string` Name of an initializer (how serialized data would refer to it).

  2. `fn`: `function` Initializer function (returning value for serialized data to use).
## Function stringify.substep(out, ptr, obj, lineBreak, depthLimit)
Serialization substep. Works similar to `stringify()` itself, but instead of returning string simply adds new terms to
`out` table. Use it in custom `__stringify` methods for serializing child items if you need the best performance.

  Parameters:

  1. `out`: `string[]` Output table with words to concatenate later (without any joining string).

  2. `ptr`: `integer` Position within `out` table to write next word into. At the very start, when table is empty, it would be 1.

  3. `obj`: `any` Item to serialize.

  4. `lineBreak`: `string|nil` Line break with some spaces for aligning child items, or `nil` if compact stringify mode is used. One tab is two spaces.

  5. `depthLimit`: `integer` Limits how many steps down serialization can go. If 0 or below, no tables would be serialized.

  Returns:

  - `integer` Updated `ptr` value (if one item was added to `out`, should increase by 1).
## Function stringify.binary(obj)
Different serializer, produces binary data instead of human-readable. Faster and with even more compact output, but not human-readable.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil` Object to serialize.

  Returns:

  - `string` String with input data presented in binary format, so it won’t be readable and will contain zero bytes.
## Function stringify.binary.parse(serialized)
Parses binary data prepared with `stringify.binary()`.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string` Serialized data.

  Returns:

  - `table|number|string|boolean|nil`
## Function stringify.binary.tryParse(serialized, fallback)
Tries to parse binary data prepared with `stringify.binary()`.

Returns fallback value if failed to parse, or if `serialized` is empty or not set, or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string?` Serialized data.

  2. `fallback`: `T|nil` Value to return if parsing failed.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Class ClassStringifiable
A small helper to add as a parent class for EmmyLua to work better.

- `ClassStringifiable:__stringify(out, ptr, obj, lineBreak, depthLimit)`

  Serialize instance of class. Can either return a `string`, or construct it into `out` table and return a new position in it. String itself should be a like of
Lua code which would reconstruct the object on deserialization. Don’t forget to either register referred function with `stringify.register()` or provide
a reference to it in `namespace` table with `stringify.parse()`.

Note: to serialize sub-objects, such as constructor arguments, you can use `stringify()` or `stringify.substep()` if you’re using an approach with
manually constructing `out` table. Alternatively for basic types you can use `string.format()`: “%q” would give you a string in Lua format, so you can use it
like so:
```lua
function MyClass:__serialize()
  return string.format('MyClass(%q, %s)', self.stringName, self.numericalCounter)
end
```

  Parameters:

    1. `out`: `string[]` Output table with words to concatenate later (without any joining string).

    2. `ptr`: `integer` Position within `out` table to write next word into. At the very start, when table is empty, it would be 1.

    3. `obj`: `any` Item to serialize.

    4. `lineBreak`: `string|nil` Line break with some spaces for aligning child items, or `nil` if compact stringify mode is used. One tab is two spaces.

    5. `depthLimit`: `integer` Limits how many steps down serialization can go. If 0 or below, no tables would be serialized.

  Returns:

    - `integer` Updated `ptr` value (if one item was added to `out`, should increase by 1).

# Module common/json.lua

## Function JSON.stringify(data)
Serializes a Lua entity (like a table) into a compact JSON.

  Parameters:

  1. `data`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function JSON.parse(data)
Parses a compact JSON into a Lua entity. Note: if JSON is damaged, parser won’t throw an error, but
results might be somewhat unpredictable. It’s an intended behaviour: in 99% of cases JSON parser
used to exchange data with, for example, API endpoints, will receive correct data, but some of those
AC JSON files are pretty screwed and often include things like missing commas, comments, etc.

  Parameters:

  1. `data`: `string?`

  Returns:

  - `any`

# Module common/ac_primitive_vec2.d.lua

## Function vec2.new(x, y)
Creates new vector. It’s usually faster to create a new item with `vec2(x, y)` directly, but the way LuaJIT works,

various calls (which also makes it slightly slower).

  Returns:

  - `vec2`
## Function vec2.isvec2(p)
Checks if value is vec2 or not.

  Parameters:

  1. `p`: `any`

## Function vec2.intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4)
Intersects two line segments, one going from `p1` to `p2` and another going from `p3` to `p4`. Returns intersection point or `nil` if there is no intersection.

  Returns:

  - `vec2`
## Function vec2(x, y)
Two-dimensional vector. All operators are overloaded. Note: creating a lot of new vectors can create extra work for garbage collector reducing overall effectiveness.
Where possible, instead of using mathematical operators consider using methods altering state of already existing vectors. So, instead of:
```lua
someVec = vec2()
…
someVec = math.normalize(vec1 + vec2) * 10
```
Consider rewriting it like:
```lua
someVec = vec2()
…
someVec:set(vec1):add(vec2):normalize():scale(10)
```

  Parameters:

  1. `x`: `number?`

  2. `y`: `number?`

## Class vec3
Three-dimensional vector. All operators are overloaded.
Note: creating a lot of new vectors can create extra work for garbage collector reducing overall effectiveness.
Where possible, instead of using mathematical operators consider using methods altering state of already existing vectors. So, instead of:
```lua
someVec = vec3()
…
someVec = math.normalize(vec1 + vec2) * 10
```
Consider rewriting it like:
```lua
someVec = vec3()
…
someVec:set(vec1):add(vec2):normalize():scale(10)
```

- `vec3.new(x, y, z)`

  Creates new vector. It’s usually faster to create a new item with `vec3(x, y, z)` directly, but the way LuaJIT works,
that call only works with three numbers. If you only provide a single number, rest will be set to 0. This call, however, supports
various calls (which also makes it slightly slower).

  Returns:

    - `vec3`

# Module lib_social.lua

## Function ac.isTaggedAsFriend(driverName)
Checks if a user is tagged as a friend. Uses CSP and CM databases. Deprecated, use `ac.DriverTags` instead.

  Parameters:

  1. `driverName`: `string` Driver name.

  Returns:

  - `boolean`
## Function ac.tagAsFriend(driverName, isFriend)
Tags user as a friend (or removes the tag if `false` is passed). Deprecated, use `ac.DriverTags` instead.

  1. `driverName`: `string` Driver name.

  2. `isFriend`: `boolean?` Default value: `true`.
## Function web.loadRemoteModel(source, callback)
Loads a ZIP file from a given URL, unpacks first KN5 from it to a cache folder and returns
its filename through a callback. If file is already in cache storage, doesn’t do anything and
simply returns filename to it. After callback is called, that filename could be used to load
KN5 in the scene.

If there is a VAO patch in a ZIP file, it will be extracted next to KN5.

Note: only valid KN5 files and VAO patches are supported. Heavy caching is applied: if model was
downloaded once, it would not be re-downloaded (unlike with remote textures where proper HTTP caching
rules apply). If model was not accessed for a couple of weeks, it’ll be removed.

If you need to download several entities and do something afterwards, it might help to use some
promise Lua library.

Use `web.loadRemoteAssets()` instead.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, filename: string)`
## Function web.loadRemoteAnimation(source, callback)
Loads a ZIP file from a given URL, unpacks first KsAnim from it to a cache folder and returns
its filename through a callback. If file is already in cache storage, doesn’t do anything and
simply returns filename to it. After callback is called, that filename could be used to animate
objects in the scene. If animation was not accessed for a couple of weeks, it’ll be removed.

If you need to download several entities and do something afterwards, it might help to use some
promise Lua library.

Use `web.loadRemoteAssets()` instead.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, filename: string)`
## Function web.loadRemoteAssets(source, callback)
Loads a ZIP file from a given URL, unpacks assets from it to a cache folder and returns
path to the folder in a callback. If files are already in cache storage, doesn’t do anything and
simply returns the path. After callback is called, you can use path to the folder to get full paths to those assets.
If assets are not accessed for a couple of weeks, they’ll be removed.

Since 0.2.10, scripts with I/O access are allowed to extract all types of files using this function.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>, crucial: string?}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table. Field `crucial` acts similar to `crucial` of `io.extractFromZipAsync()`.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, folder: string)`
## Function web.resolveDNS(url, callback)
Resolve hostname, return IPv4 via a callback.

  Parameters:

  1. `url`: `string`

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string?, response: string?)`
## Function web.encryptKey(key)

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `string`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function ac.loadSoundbank(soundbank, guids)
Loads FMOD soundbank. After soundbank is loaded, new audio events can be created which would refer to
events in the soundbank. If soundbank is missing, new audio events can still be created, but they won’t be
valid. If second parameter is missing, “GUIDs.txt” in the same folder as soundbank will be loaded. Returns
true if both files were found properly. Also, if used before audio engine is initialized, it would postpone
loading until that happens (function returns straight away, and you can create new audio events straight
away, but they would only become valid after audio initialization is complete).

  Parameters:

  1. `soundbank`: `string` Path to “.bank” file, could be absolute or relative to Lua script folder.

  2. `guids`: `string?` Path to “.txt” file with GUIDs, if missing, “GUIDs.txt” from soundbank folder will be used.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` Returns `true` if both files were found.
## Function ac.isAudioReady()
Checks if audio engine is initialized and ready to work. Until then, all created audio events would return `false`
in their `:isValid()` methods, it doesn’t mean that there is a problem with soundbank (yet).

  Returns:

  - `boolean`
## Function ac.setAudioEventMultiplier(surfaceWav, mult)
Set volume multiplier for audio associated with a certain surface. Returns `false` if there are no events associated with this type of surface.

  Parameters:

  1. `surfaceWav`: `string`

  2. `mult`: `number`

  Returns:

  - `boolean`
## Class ac.AudioEvent
Audio event is a audio emitter which uses a certain event from one of loaded FMOD soundbanks.

- `ac.AudioEvent:setPosition(pos, dir, up, vel)`

  Sets audio event orientation.

  Parameters:

    1. `pos`: `vec3` Position. If you’re working on a car script, position is relative to car position.

    2. `dir`: `vec3|nil` Direction. If missing, forwards vector is used.

    3. `up`: `vec3|nil` Vector directed up for full 3D orientation.

    4. `vel`: `vec3|nil` Velocity of audio source. If missing, sound is stationary. If you’re working on a car script, velocity is relative to car velocity.

  Returns:

    - `ac.AudioEvent` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.AudioEvent:setVolumeChannel(channel)`

  Override used volume channel. Use carefully.

    3. `value`: `number`

  Returns:

    - `ac.AudioEvent` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.AudioEvent:isValid()`

  Returns `true` if event is loaded successfully. If event does not load, make sure soundbank is loaded first, and that event name is correct. If event is loaded
from a file and finished playing, also returns `false`.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ac.AudioEvent:isPlaying()`

  Returns `true` if audio event is playing.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ac.AudioEvent:isWithinRange()`

  Return `true` if audio event is within hearing range of current listener. Could be a good way to pause some expensive processing
for distant audio events. Although in general comparing distance with a threshold on Lua side with vectors might be faster (without
going Lua→CSP→FMOD and back).

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ac.AudioEvent:resume()`

  function _ac_AudioEvent:resume() end

- `ac.AudioEvent:resumeIf(condition)`

  If condition is `true`, start an audio event if it’s stopped, resume it if it’s paused. If condition is false, stop audio event.

  Returns:

    - `number` Returns `-1` if actual duration is not available.

- `ac.AudioEvent:getTransformationRaw()`

  If you need to move audio event often, accessing its matrix directly might be the best way. But you have to be extra careful in
making sure matrix is always normalized (vectors `side`, `up` and `look` should be othrogonal with lengths of 1), otherwise
audio might sound strange, with rapid changes in volume.

  Returns:

    - `mat4x4`

- `ac.AudioEvent:dispose()`

  Stop and remove audio event.
function _ac_AudioEvent:dispose() end

  Parameters:

  1. `pos`: `vec3`

  2. `normal`: `vec3`

  3. `uv`: `vec2`

  Returns:

  - `ac.MeshVertex`
## Class ac.MeshVertex
Mesh vertex.
## Function ac.MeshVertex.new(pos, normal, uv)
Creates new mesh vertex.

  Parameters:

  1. `pos`: `vec3`

  2. `normal`: `vec3`

  3. `uv`: `vec2`

  Returns:

  - `ac.MeshVertex`
## Function ac.VertexBuffer(size)
Buffer with mesh vertices. Contains `ac.MeshVertex` items.

  Parameters:

  1. `size`: `nil|integer|ac.MeshVertex[]` Initial size or initializing values.

  Returns:

  - `ac.VertexBuffer`
## Class ac.VertexBuffer
Buffer with mesh vertices. Contains `ac.MeshVertex` items.

- `ac.VertexBuffer:get(index)`

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

  Returns:

    - `ac.MeshVertex`

- `ac.VertexBuffer:set(index, vertex)`

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

    2. `vertex`: `ac.MeshVertex`
## Function ac.IndicesBuffer(size)

  Parameters:

  1. `size`: `nil|integer|integer[]` Initial size or initializing values.

  Returns:

  - `ac.IndicesBuffer`
## Class ac.IndicesBuffer
Buffer with mesh indieces. Contains `integer` items (limited by 16 bits for AC to handle).
## Class ac.SceneReference
Reference to one or several objects in scene. Works similar to those jQuery things which would refer to one or
several of webpage elements. Use methods like `ac.findNodes()` to get one. Once you have a reference to some nodes,
you can load additional KN5s, create new nodes and such in it.
Note: it might be beneficial in general to prefer methods like `ac.findNodes()` and `ac.findMeshes()` over `ac.findAny()`.
Should be fewer surprises this way.

- `ac.SceneReference:dispose()`

  Dispose any resources associated with this `ac.SceneReference` and empty it out. Use it if you need to remove a previously
created node or a loaded KN5.
function _ac_SceneReference:dispose() end

- `ac.SceneReference:setOutline(color)`

  Set debug outline for meshes in the reference. Outline remains active until explicitly disabled or until reference is released.
Note: each outlined group adds a render target switch and additional draw calls, so avoid adding it to more than, let’s say,
ten groups at once (each group can have multiple meshes in it).

  Parameters:

    1. `color`: `rgbm?` Outline color. Use `nil` or transparent color to disable outline.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setMaterialProperty(property, value)`

  Set material property. Be careful to match the type (you need the same amount of numeric values). If you’re using boolean,-
resulting value will be either 1 or 0.

  Parameters:

    1. `property`: `string|"'ksEmissive'"`

    2. `value`: `number|vec2|vec3|rgb|vec4|rgbm|boolean`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setMaterialTexture(texture, value)`

  Set material texture. Three possible uses:

1. Pass color to create a new solid color texture:
  ```lua
  meshes:setMaterialTexture('txDiffuse', rgbm(1, 0, 0, 1)) -- for red color
  ```
2. Pass filename to load a new texture. Be careful, it would load texture syncronously unless it
  was loaded before:
  ```lua
  meshes:setMaterialTexture('txDiffuse', 'filename.dds')
  ```
  Since 0.2.2 nothing will happen if the texture is missing (previously it’ll use black transparent texture).
3. Pass a table with parameters to draw a texture in a style of scriptable displays. Be careful as to
  not call it too often, make sure to limit refresh rate unless you really need a quick update. If you’re
  working on a track script, might also be useful to check if camera is close enough with something like
  ac.getSim().cameraPosition:closerToThan(display coordinates, some distance)
  ```lua
  meshes:setMaterialTexture('txDiffuse', {
    textureSize = vec2(1024, 1024), -- although optional, I recommend to set it: skin could replace texture by one with different resolution
    background = rgbm(1, 0, 0, 1),  -- set to `nil` (or remove) to reuse original texture as background, set to `false` to skip background preparation completely
    region = {                      -- if not set, whole texture will be repainted
        from = vec2(200, 300),
        size = vec2(400, 400)
    },
    callback = function (dt)
      display.rect{ pos = …, size = …, … }
    end
  })
  ```

  Parameters:

    1. `texture`: `string|"'txDiffuse'"|"'txNormal'"|"'txEmissive'"|"'txMaps'"` Name of a texture slot.

    2. `value`: `{callback: fun(dt: number), textureSize: vec2, region: {from: vec2, size: vec2}, background: rgbm|boolean|nil}|`{callback` = function (dt)  end, textureSize = vec2(512, 512), region = {from = vec2(0, 0), size = vec2(512, 512)}}`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:ensureUniqueMaterials()`

  Ensures all materials are unique, allowing to alter their textures and material properties without affecting the rest of the scene. Only
ensures uniqueness relative to the rest of the scene. For example, if it refers to two meshes using the same material, they’ll continue
to share material, but it would be their own material, separate from the scene.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:storeCurrentTransformation()`

  Stores current transformation to be restored when `ac.SceneReference` is disposed (for example, when script reloads). Might be a good
idea to use it first on any nodes you’re going to move, so all of them would get back when script is reloaded (assuming their original 
transformation is important, like it is with needles, for example).

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:clearMotion()`

  CSP keeps track of previous world position of each node to do its motion blur. This call would clear that value, so teleported, for
example, objects wouldn’t have motion blur artifacts for a frame.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:size()`

  Number of elements in this reference. Alternatively, you can use `#` operator.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.SceneReference:empty()`

  If reference is empty or not.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Reference to found skinned meshes.

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Reference to found skinned meshes.

- `ac.SceneReference:createNode(name, keepAlive)`

  Create a new node with a given name and attach it as a child.

  Parameters:

    1. `name`: `string`

    2. `keepAlive`: `boolean|`true`|`false`` Set to `true` to create a long-lasting node which wouldn’t be removed when script is reloaded.

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Newly created node or `nil` if failed

- `ac.SceneReference:createMesh(name, materialName, vertices, indices, keepAlive, moveData)`

  Create a new mesh with a given name and attach it as a child. Steals passed vertices and indices to avoid reallocating
memory, so make sure to use `vertices:clone()` when passing if you want to keep the original data.

  Parameters:

    1. `name`: `string`

    2. `materialName`: `string?`

    3. `vertices`: `ac.VertexBuffer`

    4. `indices`: `ac.IndicesBuffer`

    5. `keepAlive`: `boolean|`true`|`false`` Set to `true` to create a long-lasting node which wouldn’t be removed when script is reloaded.

    6. `moveData`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to move vertices and indices data thus saving on reallocating memory. You can use `vertices:clone()` for one of them to retain original array. Default value: `false`.

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Newly created mesh or `nil` if failed

- `ac.SceneReference:alterVertices(vertices)`

  Replace mesh vertices dynamically. New number of vertices should match existing one, indices work the same. Can be used for dynamic
mesh alteration (for example, deformation). Calling it each frame with highly detailed mesh might still affect performance negatively though.

  Parameters:

    1. `vertices`: `ac.VertexBuffer`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:getVertices()`

  Get vertices of a first mesh in selection. Makes a copy into an `ac.VertexBuffer`, so it might be expensive to call each frame, but it can be called
once for those vertices to later be used with `:alterVertices()` method.

  Returns:

    - `ac.VertexBuffer`

- `ac.SceneReference:getIndices()`

  Get indices of a first mesh in selection. Makes a copy into an `ac.IndicesBuffer`, so it might be expensive to call each frame.
Note: order of vertices from KN5 might be altered by the built-in mesh optimizer.

  Returns:

    - `ac.IndicesBuffer`

- `ac.SceneReference:createBoundingSphereNode(name, radius)`

  Create a new bounding sphere node with a given name and attach it as a child. Using those might help with performance: children
would skip bounding frustum test, and whole node would not get traversed during rendering if it’s not in frustum.

Note: for it to work properly, it’s better to attach it to AC cars node, as that one does expect those bounding sphere nodes
to be inside of it. You can find it with `ac.findNodes('carsRoot:yes')`.

  Parameters:

    1. `name`: `string`

    2. `radius`: `number` Radius in meters.

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Can return `nil` if failed.

- `ac.SceneReference:loadKN5(filename)`

  Load KN5 model and attach it as a child. To use remote models, first load them with `web.loadRemoteModel()`.

Node: The way it actually works, KN5 would be loaded in a pool and then copied here (with sharing
of resources such as vertex buffers). This generally helps with performance.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string|{filename: string, filter: string}` KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder. Since 0.2.5, you can instead pass a table with filename and a filter (for example, `'{ ! renderable:no }'`; note that filter will applied to every node and mesh).

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Can return `nil` if failed.

- `ac.SceneReference:loadKN5LOD(filename, mainFilename)`

  Load KN5 LOD model and attach it as a child. Parameter `mainFilename` should refer to the main KN5 with all the textures.

Node: The way it actually works, KN5 would be loaded in a pool and then copied here (with sharing
of resources such as vertex buffers). This generally helps with performance. Main KN5 would be
loaded as well, but not shown, and instead kept in a pool.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string|{filename: string, filter: string}` KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder. Since 0.2.5, you can instead pass a table with filename and a filter (for example, `'{ ! renderable:no }'`; note that filter will applied to every node and mesh).

    2. `mainFilename`: `string` Main KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder.

  Returns:

    - `ac.SceneReference` Can return `nil` if failed.

- `ac.SceneReference:loadKN5Async(filename, callback)`

  Load KN5 model and attach it as a child asyncronously. To use remote models, first load them with `web.loadRemoteModel()`.

Node: The way it actually works, KN5 would be loaded in a pool and then copied here (with sharing
of resources such as vertex buffers). This generally helps with performance.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string|{filename: string, filter: string}` KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder. Since 0.2.5, you can instead pass a table with filename and a filter (for example, `'{ ! renderable:no }'`; note that filter will applied to every node and mesh).

    2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, loaded: ac.SceneReference?)` Callback called once model is loaded.

- `ac.SceneReference:loadKN5LODAsync(filename, mainFilename, callback)`

  Load KN5 model and attach it as a child asyncronously. Parameter `mainFilename` should refer to the main KN5 with all the textures.

Node: The way it actually works, KN5 would be loaded in a pool and then copied here (with sharing
of resources such as vertex buffers). This generally helps with performance. Main KN5 would be
loaded as well, but not shown, and instead kept in a pool.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string|{filename: string, filter: string}` KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder. Since 0.2.5, you can instead pass a table with filename and a filter (for example, `'{ ! renderable:no }'`; note that filter will applied to every node and mesh).

    2. `mainFilename`: `string` Main KN5 filename relative to script folder or AC root folder.

    3. `callback`: `fun(err: string, loaded: ac.SceneReference?)` Callback called once model is loaded.

- `ac.SceneReference:setAnimation(filename, position, force)`

  Loads animation from a file (on first call only), sets animation position. To use remote animations, first load them with `web.loadRemoteAnimation()`.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string` Animation filename (”…ksanim”). If set to `nil`, no animation will be applied.

    2. `position`: `number?` Animation position from 0 to 1. Default value: 0.

    3. `force`: `boolean?` If not set to `true`, animation will be applied only if position is different from position used previously. Default value: `false`.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setVisible(visible, resetMotion)`

  Parameters:

    1. `visible`: `boolean|`true`|`false``

    2. `resetMotion`: `boolean?` Default value: `true`. Pass `false` to not reset object motion (if you teleport object somewhere and make it visible all at once without using this option, it’ll appear blurry). Note: you can always use `:clearMotion()` to reset motion manually. Doesn’t have an effect if object has already been visible (in this case, this function doesn’t do anything). 

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

  Gets an attribute value.

  Parameters:

    1. `key`: `string`

    2. `defaultValue`: `number|string|nil` If `nil` is passed, returns string (or `nil` if attribute is not set).

  Returns:

    - `string|number|nil` Type is determined based on type of `defaultValue`.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `number`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setPosition(pos)`

  Sets position of a node (or nodes).

Note: only nodes can move. If you need to move meshes, find their parent node and move it. If its parent node has more than a single mesh as a child,
create a new node as a child of that parent and move mesh there.

  Parameters:

    1. `pos`: `vec3`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setOrientation(look, up)`

  Sets orientation of a node (or nodes). If vector `up` is not provided, facing up vector will be used.

Note: only nodes can rotate. If you need to rotate meshes, find their parent node and rotate it. If its parent node has more than a single mesh as a child,
create a new node as a child of that parent and move mesh there.

  Parameters:

    1. `look`: `vec3`

    2. `up`: `vec3|nil`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setRotation(axis, angleRad)`

  Replaces orientation of a node (or nodes) with rotational matrix. If you want to just rotate node from its current orientation, use `:rotate()`.

Note: only nodes can rotate. If you need to rotate meshes, find their parent node and rotate it. If its parent node has more than a single mesh as a child,
create a new node as a child of that parent and move mesh there.

  Parameters:

    1. `axis`: `vec3`

    2. `angleRad`: `number`

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:rotate(axis, angleRad)`

create a new node as a child of that parent and move mesh there.

  Parameters:

- `ac.SceneReference:getWorldTransformationRaw()`

  Returns world transformation matrix of the first node. Do not use it to move node in world space (if you need
to move in world space, either use `ref:getTransformationRaw():set(worldSpaceTransform:mul(ref:getParent():getWorldTransformationRaw():inverse()))` or
simply move your node to a node without transformation, like root of dynamic objects). Be careful though, if there
are no nodes in the list, it would return `nil`.

- `ac.SceneReference:raycast(ray, outSceneRef, outPosRef, outNormalRef, outUVRef, culling)`

  Casts a ray prepared by something like `render.createRay(pos, dir, length)` or `render.createMouseRay()`. Accounts for ray length (since 0.2.10). You can use this method on individual meshes, lists of meshes, or nodes as well (it’ll go over all the child meshes, but the actual expensive raycast would happen only if ray intersects a mesh bounding sphere).

If you need to access a mesh that was hit, set second argument to true:
```lua
local hitDistance, hitMesh = mesh:raycast(render.createRay(pos, dir), true)
if hitDistance ~= -1 then
  print(hitMesh:name())
end
```
Alternatively, reuse your own scene reference for better performance if you need to cast
a lot of rays:
```lua
local hitMesh = ac.emptySceneReference()
local hitDistance = mesh:raycast(render.createRay(pos, dir), hitMesh)
if hitDistance ~= -1 then
  print(hitMesh:name())
end

  Returns:

    1. `number` Distance to hit, or -1 if there was no hit.

    2. `ac.SceneReference|nil` Reference to a mesh that was hit (same as `outSceneRef`, doubled here for convenience).

Skin is a table storing texture names and filenames to skin textures. Example:
```lua
local skinDir = ac.getFolder(ac.FolderID.ContentCars) .. '/' .. ac.getCarID(0) .. '/skins/my_skin'
ac.findNodes('carRoot:0'):applySkin({

    1. `active`: `boolean|`true`|`false``

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:setMaterialsFrom(materialSceneRef)`

  Finds materials in another scene reference that have the same names as materials in a given scene reference,
and copies them over, so after that both references would share materials. Example use case: if you have LOD A and
LOD B and LOD A got unique materials (because there are multiple objects sharing same KN5 model), with this function
it’s possible to sync together materials from LOD A and LOD B by running `lodB:setMaterialsFrom(lodA)`. And because
materials would not be actually copied, but instead shared, any consequent change of material properly in LOD A would
be mirrored in LOD B.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:at(index, outSceneRef)`

  Creates a new scene reference with just a single item from the original scene reference.
Indices are 1-based. By default it would create a new scene reference, if you need to access
a lot of objects fast, provide your own:
```lua
  local meshes = ac.findMeshes('shader:ksTree')
  local ref = ac.emptySceneReference()
  for i = 1, #meshes do
    meshes:at(i, ref)
    print(ref:name())  -- note: for this particular case, it would be more optimal to use meshes:name(i) instead

    2. `corners`: `number[]` Four numbers for corner intensity.

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:applyShaderReplacements(data, includeType)`

  Applies shader replacements stored in INI config format. Can optionally load included files, so templates
work as well. If there is no symbol “[” in `data`, applies passed values to all meshes and materials in selection.

  Parameters:

    1. `data`: `string|ac.INIConfig` Config in INIPP format.

    2. `includeType`: `ac.IncludeType?` Include type. If not set, includes will not be resolved, so templates won’t work. Default value: `ac.IncludeType.None`.

- `ac.SceneReference:projectTexture(params)`

  Projects texture onto a mesh or few meshes, draws result. Use in when updating a dynamic texture, display or an extra canvas.
Position, and directions are set in world space.

Note: this is not a regular IMGUI drawing call, so most functions, such as shading offsets, transformations or clipping, would 
not work here.

Tip 1: if you want to draw a new skin for a car and apply AO to it, one way might be to draw it in a canvas and then draw
original AO texture on top with special shading parameters:
```lua
-- drawing rest of skin here
ui.setShadingOffset(0, 0, 0, -1)
ui.drawImage('car::EXT_body.dds', 0, ui.windowSize(), rgbm.colors.black)  -- with these shading offset properties, texture
    -- will be drawn in black with inverse of brightness used for opacity
ui.resetShadingOffset()
```

Tip 2: if you want to project things on meshes with certain material, make sure to filter out meshes so that it would only
affect meshes from LOD A (instead of `ac.findMeshes('material:car_paint')` use `ac.findMeshes('{ material:car_paint & lod:A}')`),
otherwise there’d be quite a few artifacts. I spent some time like this trying to figure out why results were off.

Default value: `false`.\n- `uvOffset` (`vec2`): Optional UV offset. By default CSP estimates an UV offset such that most triagles would be shown. If mapping is way off though, it might need tweaking (or even repeated calls with different offsets).\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Optional override for blend mode. Default value: `render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate`.\n- `mask1` (`string`): Optional masking texture.\n- `mask1UV1` (`vec2`): Optional masking texture UV coordinates.\n- `mask1UV2` (`vec2`): Optional masking texture UV coordinates.\n- `mask1Flags` (`render.TextureMaskFlags`): Optional masking texture flags.\n- `mask2` (`string`): Optional secondary masking texture.\n- `mask2UV1` (`vec2`): Optional secondary masking texture UV coordinates.\n- `mask2UV2` (`vec2`): Optional secondary masking texture UV coordinates.\n- `mask2Flags` (`render.TextureMaskFlags`): Optional secondary masking texture flags."

  Returns:

    - `self` Returns self for easy chaining.

- `ac.SceneReference:projectShader(params)`

  Projects shader onto a mesh or few meshes, draws result. Use in when updating a dynamic texture, display or an extra canvas.
Position, and directions are set in world space. Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.      

Example:
```lua
local ray = render.createMouseRay()
meshes:projectShader({
  async = true,
  pos = ray.pos,
  look = ray.dir,
  blendMode = render.BlendMode.Opaque,
  textures = {
    txInput1 = 'texture.png',  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “tx”
    txInput2 = mediaPlayer,
    txMissing = false
  },
  values = {
    gValueColor = rgbm(1, 2, 0, 0.5),  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “g”
    gValueNumber = math.random(),
    gValueVec = vec2(1, 2),
    gFlag = math.random() > 0.5
  },
  shader = [[
    float4 main(PS_IN pin) { 
      if (dot(abs(pin.Tex * 2 - 1), 1) > 0.5) return 0;
      float4 in1 = txInput1.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex);
      float4 in2 = txInput2.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex + gValueVec);
      return gFlag ? pin.NormalView * in1 + in2 * gValueColor : in2;
    }
  ]]
})
```

Tip: to simplify and speed things up, it might make sense to move table outside of a function to reuse it from frame
to frame, simply accessing and updating textures, values and other parameters before call. However, make sure not to
add new textures and values, otherwise it would require to recompile shader and might lead to VRAM leaks (if you would
end up having thousands of no more used shaders). If you don’t have a working texture at the time of first creating
that table, use `false` for missing texture value.

Note: if shader would fail to compile, a C++ exception will be triggered, terminating script completely (to prevent AC 
from crashing, C++ exceptions halt Lua script that triggered them until script gets a full reload).

  Parameters:

    1. `params`: `{pos: vec3, look: vec3, up: vec3, size: vec2, withDepth: boolean, expanded: boolean, uvOffset: vec2, blendMode: render.BlendMode, async: boolean, cacheKey: number, defines: table, textures: table, values: table, directValuesExchange: boolean, shader: string}|`{pos` = vec3(), look = vec3(), up = vec3(0, 1, 0), size = vec2(), withDepth = true, expanded = true, blendMode = render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate, textures = {}, values = {}, shader = 'float4 main(PS_IN pin) {return float4(pin.Tex.x, pin.Tex.y, 0, 1);}'}` "Table with properties:\n- `pos` (`vec3`): Position from which texture will be projected, in world space.\n- `look` (`vec3`): Direction with which texture will be projected, in world space.\n- `up` (`vec3`): Optional vector directed up, to specify texture rotation.\n- `size` (`vec2`): Size, horizontal and vertical. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `withDepth` (`boolean`): If depth is used, nearest to projection position triagles will have higher priority (in case of overlapping UV), slightly slower, but produces better results (especially with `expanded` set to `true`).\n- `expanded` (`boolean`): Draws each mesh four additional times with small offsets to fill partically covered pixels. More expensive (but less expensive comparing to fixing issue with those half covered pixels with additional draw calls via Lua).\n- `uvOffset` (`vec2`): Optional UV offset. By default CSP estimates an UV offset such that most triagles would be shown. If mapping is way off though, it might need tweaking (or even repeated calls with different offsets).\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Blend mode. Default value: `render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate`.\n- `async` (`boolean`): If set to `true`, drawing won’t occur until shader would be compiled in a different thread.\n- `cacheKey` (`number`): Optional cache key for compiled shader (caching will depend on shader source code, but not on included files, so make sure to change the key if included files have changed).\n- `defines` (`table`): Defines to pass to the shader, either boolean, numerical or string values (don’t forget to wrap complex expressions in brackets). False values won’t appear in code and true will be replaced with 1 so you could use `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` with them.\n- `textures` (`table`): Table with textures to pass to a shader. For textures, anything passable in `ui.image()` can be used (filename, remote URL, media element, extra canvas, etc.). If you don’t have a texture and need to reset bound one, use `false` for a texture value (instead of `nil`)\n- `values` (`table`): Table with values to pass to a shader. Values can be numbers, booleans, vectors, colors or 4×4 matrix. Values will be aligned automatically.\n- `directValuesExchange` (`boolean`): If you’re reusing table between calls instead of recreating it each time and pass `true` as this parameter, `values` table will be swapped with an FFI structure allowing to skip data copying step and achieve the best performance. Note: with this mode, you’ll have to transpose matrices manually.\n- `shader` (`string`): Shader code (format is HLSL, regular DirectX shader); actual code will be added into a template in “assettocorsa/extension/internal/shader-tpl/project.fx” (look into it to see what fields are available)."

  Returns:

    - `boolean` Returns `false` if shader is not yet ready and no drawing occured (happens only if `async` is set to `true`).
## Function ac.emptySceneReference()

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.findAny(s)
Creates a new scene reference containing objects (nodes, meshes, etc.) collected with a filter from root node associated with current script. For most scripts it would be an AC root node. For track scripts,
track root node. For car scripts, car’s root.

Node: for most cases, using `ac.findNodes()`, `ac.findMeshes()` and similar would work better.

  Parameters:

  1. `s`: `string` Node/mesh filter.

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.findNodes(s)
Creates a new scene reference containing nodes collected with a filter from root node associated with current script. For most scripts it would be an AC root node. For track scripts,
track root node. For car scripts, car’s root.

Just a reminder, nodes refer to parent objects. Themselves, don’t get rendered, only their children elements (which might be nodes or meshes), but they can move.

Filter is regular stuff, the same as used in INI configs. To use complex filter with commas and operators, wrap it in curly brackets as usual. There are also some special keywords available:
- `'luaRoot:yes'`: root node associated with current script.
- `'sceneRoot:yes'`: the most root node (do not add your objects here, they won’t be drawn properly).
- `'carsRoot:yes'`: node that hosts all the cars. If you want to load custom dynamic objects, especially complex, it’s recommended to load them in bounding sphere and attach here (this node is optimized to render bounding sphere-wrapped objects quickly).
- `'trackRoot:yes'`: track root node.
- `'staticRoot:yes'`: node with static geometry (affected by motion blur from original AC).
- `'dynamicRoot:yes'`: node with dynamic geometry (node affected by motion blur from original AC).

Note: if you’re adding new objects to a car, seach for `'BODYTR'` node. Car root remains stationary and hosts “BODYTR” for main car model and things like wheels and suspension nodes.

  Parameters:

  1. `s`: `string` Node filter.

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.findMeshes(s)
Creates a new scene reference containing meshes collected with a filter from root node associated with current script. For most scripts it would be an AC root node. For track scripts,
track root node. For car scripts, car’s root.

Just as a reminder, meshes can’t move. If you want to move a mesh, find its parent node and move it. If parent node has more than a single mesh, you can create a new parent node and move
mesh found with `ac.findMeshes()` there.

Filter is regular stuff, the same as used in INI configs. To use complex filter with commas and operators, wrap it in curly brackets as usual.

  Parameters:

  1. `s`: `string` Mesh filter.

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.findSkinnedMeshes(s)
Creates a new scene reference containing skinned meshes collected with a filter from root node associated with current script. For most scripts it would be an AC root node. For track scripts,
track root node. For car scripts, car’s root.

Filter is regular stuff, the same as used in INI configs. To use complex filter with commas and operators, wrap it in curly brackets as usual.

  Parameters:

  1. `s`: `string` Mesh filter.

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.findByClass(objectClass, s)
Creates a new scene reference containing objects of a certain class collected with a filter from root node associated with current script. For most scripts it would be an AC root node. For track scripts,
track root node. For car scripts, car’s root.

Filter is regular stuff, the same as used in INI configs. To use complex filter with commas and operators, wrap it in curly brackets as usual.

  Parameters:

  1. `objectClass`: `ac.ObjectClass` Objects class.

  2. `s`: `string` Mesh filter.

  Returns:

  - `ac.SceneReference`
## Function ac.GeometryShot(sceneReference, resolution, mips, withDepth, antialiasingMode, textureFormat, flags)

  Parameters:

  1. `sceneReference`: `ac.SceneReference|{reference: ac.SceneReference?, opaque: fun()?, transparent: fun()?}` Reference to nodes or meshes to draw, or a table with reference and callbacks for custom drawing.

  2. `resolution`: `vec2` Resolution in pixels. Usually textures with sizes of power of two work the best.

  3. `mips`: `integer?` Number of MIPs for a texture. MIPs are downsized versions of main texture used to avoid aliasing. Default value: 1 (no MIPs).

  4. `withDepth`: `boolean?` If set to `true`, depth buffer will be available to show as well.

  5. `antialiasingMode`: `render.AntialiasingMode?` Antialiasing mode. Default value: `render.AntialiasingMode.None` (disabled).

  6. `textureFormat`: `render.TextureFormat?` Texture format. Default value: `render.TextureFormat.R8G8B8A8.UNorm`. Note: antialiasing expects the default format.

  7. `flags`: `render.TextureFlags?` Extra flags. Default value: `0`.

  Returns:

  - `ac.GeometryShot`
## Class ac.GeometryShot
This thing allows to draw 3D objects in UI functions (or use them as textures in `ac.SceneReference:setMaterialTexture()`, 
for example). Prepare a scene reference (might be a bunch of nodes or meshes), create a new `ac.GeometryShot` with that reference,
call `ac.GeometryShot:update()` with camera parameters and then use resulting shot instead of a texture name.

Each `ac.GeometryShot` holds a GPU texture in R8G8B8A8 format with optional MIPs and additional depth texture in D32 format, so
don’t create too many of those and use `ac.GeometryShot:dispose()` for shots you no longer need (or just lose them to get garbage
collected, but it might take more time.

- `ac.GeometryShot:dispose()`

  Disposes geometry shot and releases resources.
function _ac_GeometryShot:dispose() end

- `ac.GeometryShot:setName(name)`

  Sets geometry shot name for debugging. Shots with set name appear in Lua Debug App, allowing to monitor their state.

  Parameters:

    1. `name`: `string?` Name to display texture as. If set to `nil` or `false`, name will be reset and texture will be hidden.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:update(pos, look, up, fov)`

  Updates texture making a shot of referenced geometry with given camera parameters. Camera coordinates are set in world space.

To make orthogonal shot, pass 0 as `fov`.

  Parameters:

    1. `pos`: `vec3` Camera position.

    2. `look`: `vec3` Camera direction.

    3. `up`: `vec3?` Camera vector facing upwards relative to camera. Default value: `vec3(0, 1, 0)`.

    4. `fov`: `number?` FOV in degrees. Default value: 90.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:depth()`

  Returns a texture reference to a depth buffer (only if created with `withDepth` set to `true`), which you can use to draw
depth buffer with something like `ui.image(shot:depth(), vec2(320, 160))`.

Note: buffer is treated like a single-channel texture so it would show in red, but with `ui.setShadingOffset()` you can draw
it differently.

- `ac.GeometryShot:clear(col)`

  Clears texture.

  Parameters:

    1. `col`: `rgbm`

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:setOpaqueAlphaFix(value)`

  Forces opaque meshes to show up as white in alpha channel. Disabled by default. Might not work with some exotic materials.

car shadows will be drawn regardless). Disabled by default.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to enable drawing of car fake shadows. Default value: `true`.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:setOriginalLighting(value)`

  Enables original lighting (stops from switching to neutral lighting active by default). With original lighting,

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

world detail), enabling particles, transparent pass, main shaders, etc. If you need something like making a nice shot
of a scene from a certain point of view, this might be a good shortcut: if more visually improving features will be 
added in the future, they’ll be included here as well.

Please avoid using it for something like rear view camera or a track display though, they could definitely benefit from
using simpler shaders or lower level of detail.

  Returns:

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:size()`

  Returns texture resolution (or zeroes if element has been disposed).

  Returns:

    - `vec2`

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GeometryShot:applyAntialiasing()`

  Manually applies antialiasing to the texture (works only if it was created with a specific antialiasing mode).
By default antialiasing is applied automatically, but calling this function switches AA to a manual mode.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GeometryShot` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ac.GeometryShot:save(filename, format)`

  Saves shot as an image.

  Parameters:

- `ac.GeometryShot:encode()`

  Returns image encoded in DDS format. Might be useful if you would need to store an image
in some custom form (if so, consider compressing it with `ac.compress()`).

Note: you can later use `ui.decodeImage()` to get a string which you can then pass as a texture name
to any of texture receiving functions. This way, you can load image into a new canvas later: just
create a new canvas (possibly using `ui.imageSize()` first to get image size) and update it drawing
imported image to the full size of the canvas.

  Returns:

    - `string|nil` Binary data, or `nil` if binary data export has failed.

- `ac.GeometryShot:accessData(callback)`

  Downloads data from GPU to CPU asyncronously (usually takes about 0.15 ms to get the data). Resulting data can be
used to access colors of individual pixels or upload it back to CPU restoring original state.

  Parameters:

    1. `callback`: `fun(err: string, data: ui.ExtraCanvasData)`

# Module lib_tracklines.lua

## Class ac.TrackPaint
Easily add new lines on a track. Automatically tries to align with track height, but correct Y coordinate is still very welcome (just use
the actual track Y coordinate, offsets to avoid clipping issues will be added automatically).

If you want to draw many lines of a flat surface, consider setting `.castStep` to `math.huge` so that raycasts would be mostly skipped. If
you find API lacking certain things, or performance not being enough, please contact me and I’ll add missing capabilities.

- `ac.TrackPaint:release()`

  Destroy everything and release resources.
function _ac_TrackPaint:release() end

- `ac.TrackPaint:reset()`

  Reset content, including drawn shapes, textures or shapes being drawn with `:to()`.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ac.TrackPaint:age(value)`

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ac.TrackPaint:line(from, to, color, thickness)`

  Quickly add a separate straight line. Does a bit of raycasting and surface alignment depending on current values of `castStep` and `forceRecast`.

Padding (see `.paddingSize`) is added to the line. This means that with large enough padding, line will appear larger.

  Parameters:

    1. `from`: `vec3` World position for first point of a line.

    2. `to`: `vec3` World positoon for the last point of a line.

    3. `color`: `rgbm?` Line color. Default value: `rgbm.colors.white`.

    4. `thickness`: `number?` Thickness in meters. If not set, `.defaultThickness` will be used.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ac.TrackPaint:image(image, pos, size, angle, color, uv1, uv2)`

  Quickly add an image. Does a bit of raycasting and surface alignment depending on current values of `castStep` and `forceRecast`.
Only four unique textures are allowed per `ac.TrackPaint()` instance. If you need more and the best performance, use atlases and texture coordinates.
Raises an error if there are too many textures set already.

Size of the resulting image is guaranteed to match input `size` no matter the padding (see `.paddingSize`). This means that with large enough padding,
image edges will be cut off.

  Parameters:

    1. `image`: `string` Texture name or image, such as `ui.decodeImage()` output.

    2. `pos`: `vec3` World position of an image.

    4. `angle`: `number?` Angle in degrees. Default value: `0`.

    5. `color`: `rgbm?` Optional color multiplying the texture color.

    6. `uv1`: `vec2?` Texture coordinates for the top left corner. Should be within 0…1 range. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`. 

    7. `uv2`: `vec2?` Texture coordinates for the bottom right corner. Should be within 0…1 range. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ac.TrackPaint:textureStart()`

  For advanced cases, use carefully. All shapes drawn between `:textureStart()` and subsequent `:textureEnd()` calls will get a texture mapped onto them.
Only four unique textures are allowed per `ac.TrackPaint()` instance. If you need more and the best performance, use atlases and texture coordinates.
Raises an error if there are too many textures set already.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ac.TrackPaint:textureEnd(image, pivot, offsetX, offsetY, uv1, uv2)`

  For advanced cases, use carefully. All shapes drawn between `:textureStart()` and subsequent `:textureEnd()` calls will get a texture mapped onto them.
Only four unique textures are allowed per `ac.TrackPaint()` instance. If you need more and the best performance, use atlases and texture coordinates.

When using, keep in mind `.paddingSize`, it could make lines visually wider.

  Parameters:

    1. `pattern`: `number[]?` Width of the first line, space between first and second, width of the second line, etc. Total width will be normalized to match stroke width.

    2. `colors`: `(rgbm|false)[]?` If set, allows to override colors for specific lines. Pass `false` to keep original color. If `pattern` is empty or defines less than two lines, ignored.

a set of points might crash or get stuck with strange cases.

If you want to add a hole to the generated mesh, first add its outline using `:to()`, then call `:fillHole()`, and after that add points to
the outer area using `:to()` and call `:fill()` to finalize the result.

Sometimes triangulation process can be helped with `:fillHint()`.

  Parameters:

    1. `color`: `rgbm?` Shape color. Default value: `rgbm.colors.white`.

  Returns:

    - `self`

## Function ui.drawImage(imageSource, p1, p2, color, uv1, uv2, mode)
Simply draws an image on canvas without adding a new item or progressing cursor. Current cursor position is not taken

When drawing multiple images, consider combining all of them in a single atlas texture, it would improve performance.

Note: if you’re using asyncronous loading (see `ui.setAsynchronousImagesLoading()`) and want to make sure image is
ready before drawing, use `ui.isImageReady()`. If image is not yet ready, transparent texture will be used instead.

## Function ui.endRotation(deg, offset)
Does actual rotation counterclockwise (or clockwise with negative values; also see note). Call this function after calling
`ui.beginRotation()` and drawing elements you need to rotate. This version would automatically calculate pivot as middle point
of drawn elements.

Note: angle of rotation is offset by 90, kept this way for compatibility. Just subtract 90 from `deg` for it to act normal.

  Parameters:

  1. `deg`: `number` Angle in degrees.

  2. `pivot`: `number|vec2` Point around which things would rotate, in window space.

  Parameters:

  1. `name`: `string`
## Function ui.popACFont()
Pops previously pushed font from stack. Note: font will not be unloaded or anything like that, feel free to use it as much as you need.
function ui.popACFont() end
## Function ui.pushDWriteFont(name)
Adds new TTF font to the stack to be used for drawing DWrite text later. Fonts are taken from “content/fonts” and “extension/fonts”, but scripts
can also use their own TTF files. To do so, use `'Font Name:path/to/file.ttf'` or `'Font Name:path/to/directory'`, path can be absolute, relative
to script folder or AC root folder. Font name can also use styling attributes, such as `Weight=Thin`, `Style=Italic` or `Stretch=Condensed`, listed
at the end after a “;” like so:
```lua
ui.pushDWriteFont('My Font:myfont.ttf;Weight=Bold;Style=Oblique;Stretch=Expanded')
```
To make things simpler, you can also use `ui.DWriteFont` helper, it provides nice methods to set attributes.

If you need to use a standard system font, set “@System” as font path: it would use faster working system fonts collection.

Update: since CSP 0.1.80 it is now possible to use a relative path to a TTF file directly. In this case, first font will be used. Note however that
if you want to use extended options and such, you’ll still need to use “<font name>:<file name>;<options>” format.

# Module common/ac_render.lua

## Function render.setTransform(pos, look, up, applySceneOriginOffset)
Affects positioning of debug shapes or meshes drawn next.

  Parameters:

  1. `pos`: `vec3`

  2. `look`: `vec3?`

  3. `up`: `vec3?`

  4. `applySceneOriginOffset`: `boolean?` Use it if your matrix is in world-space and not in graphics-space. Default value: `false`.
## Function render.bindTexture(slot, texture)
Bind texture to a certain slot directly. If you are going to use some shader call with the same texture a lot, it might be
faster to simply add texture in there with something like `Texture2D txMyTexture : register(t0);` (number after “t” in “register()”)
is the slot index and bind a texture once using this function.

  Parameters:

  1. `slot`: `integer` Slot index from 0 to 9.

  2. `texture`: `ui.ImageSource`
## Function render.fullscreenPass(params)
Draws a fullscreen pass with a custom shader. Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

Example:
```lua
render.fullscreenPass({
  async = true,
  blendMode = render.BlendMode.BlendAdd,
  textures = {
    txInput1 = 'texture.png',  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “tx”
    txInput2 = mediaPlayer,
    txMissing = false
  },
  values = {
    gValueColor = rgbm(1, 2, 0, 0.5),  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “g”
    gValueNumber = math.random(),
    gValueVec = vec2(1, 2),
    gFlag = math.random() > 0.5
  },
  shader = [[
    float4 main(PS_IN pin) {
      float4 in1 = txInput1.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex);
      float4 in2 = txInput2.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex + gValueVec);
      return pin.ApplyFog(gFlag ? in1 + in2 * gValueColor : in2);
    }
  ]]
})
```

Consider wrapping result to `pin.ApplyFog(…)` to automatically apply configured fog.

Tip: to simplify and speed things up, it might make sense to move table outside of a function to reuse it from frame
to frame, simply accessing and updating textures, values and other parameters before call. However, make sure not to
add new textures and values, otherwise it would require to recompile shader and might lead to VRAM leaks (if you would
end up having thousands of no more used shaders). If you don’t have a working texture at the time of first creating
that table, use `false` for missing texture value.

Note: if shader would fail to compile, a C++ exception will be triggered, terminating script completely (to prevent AC
from crashing, C++ exceptions halt Lua script that triggered them until script gets a full reload).

  Parameters:

  1. `params`: `{blendMode: render.BlendMode, depthMode: render.DepthMode, depth: number, async: boolean, cacheKey: number, defines: table, textures: table, values: table, directValuesExchange: boolean, shader: string}|`{blendMode` = render.BlendMode.AlphaBlend, depthMode = render.DepthMode.ReadOnlyLessEqual, textures = {}, values = {}, shader = 'float4 main(PS_IN pin) {return float4(pin.Tex.x, pin.Tex.y, 0, 1);}'}` "Table with properties:\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Blend mode. Default value: `render.BlendMode.AlphaBlend`.\n- `depthMode` (`render.DepthMode`): Depth mode. Default value: `render.DepthMode.ReadOnlyLessEqual`.\n- `depth` (`number`): Optional depth in meters, to use hardware-accelerated depth clipping.\n- `async` (`boolean`): If set to `true`, drawing won’t occur until shader would be compiled in a different thread.\n- `cacheKey` (`number`): Optional cache key for compiled shader (caching will depend on shader source code, but not on included files, so make sure to change the key if included files have changed).\n- `defines` (`table`): Defines to pass to the shader, either boolean, numerical or string values (don’t forget to wrap complex expressions in brackets). False values won’t appear in code and true will be replaced with 1 so you could use `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` with them.\n- `textures` (`table`): Table with textures to pass to a shader. For textures, anything passable in `ui.image()` can be used (filename, remote URL, media element, extra canvas, etc.). If you don’t have a texture and need to reset bound one, use `false` for a texture value (instead of `nil`)\n- `values` (`table`): Table with values to pass to a shader. Values can be numbers, booleans, vectors, colors or 4×4 matrix. Values will be aligned automatically.\n- `directValuesExchange` (`boolean`): If you’re reusing table between calls instead of recreating it each time and pass `true` as this parameter, `values` table will be swapped with an FFI structure allowing to skip data copying step and achieve the best performance. Note: with this mode, you’ll have to transpose matrices manually.\n- `shader` (`string`): Shader code (format is HLSL, regular DirectX shader); actual code will be added into a template in “assettocorsa/extension/internal/shader-tpl/fullscreen.fx”."

  Returns:

  - `boolean` Returns `false` if shader is not yet ready and no drawing occured (happens only if `async` is set to `true`).
## Function render.shaderedQuad(params)
Draws a 3D quad with a custom shader. Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

Example:
```lua
render.shaderedQuad({
  async = true,
  p1 = vec3(…),
  p2 = vec3(…),
  p3 = vec3(…),
  p4 = vec3(…),
  textures = {
    txInput1 = 'texture.png',  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “tx”
    txInput2 = mediaPlayer,
    txMissing = false
  },
  values = {
    gValueColor = rgbm(1, 2, 0, 0.5),  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “g”
    gValueNumber = math.random(),
    gValueVec = vec2(1, 2),
    gFlag = math.random() > 0.5
  },
  shader = [[
    float4 main(PS_IN pin) {
      float4 in1 = txInput1.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex);
      float4 in2 = txInput2.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex + gValueVec);
      return pin.ApplyFog(gFlag ? in1 + in2 * gValueColor : in2);
    }
  ]]
})
```

Consider wrapping result to `pin.ApplyFog(…)` to automatically apply configured fog. To set blend mode and such, use `render.setBlendMode()`.

Since v0.1.80-preview400 you can now pass `pos: vec3`, `width: number`, `height: number` instead to draw a camera-aligned
quad. You can also pass optional `up: vec3` to specify upwards direction to keep quad from tilting.

If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

To position mesh, first call `render.setTransform()`, or use a parameter `transform = mat4x4()`. Set
`transform = 'original'` if you want to use original mesh position.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

# Module common/ac_ui.lua

## Function ui.SmoothInterpolation(initialValue, weightMult)
Very simple thing for smooth UI animations. Call it with a number for its initial state and it would
return you a function. Each frame, call this function with your new target value and it would give you
a smoothly changing numerical value. Unlike functions like `math.applyLag()`, this one is a bit more
complicated, taking into account velocity as well.

  Parameters:

  1. `initialValue`: `number` Initial value with which animation will start.

  2. `weightMult`: `number?` Weight multiplier for smoother or faster animation. Default value: 1.

  Returns:

  - `fun`
## Function ui.FadingElement(drawCallback, initialState)
Another simple helper for easily creating elements fading in and out. Just pass it a draw callback and
and initial state (should it be visible or not), and then call returned function every frame passing it
a boolean to specify if item should be visible or not. Example:
```lua
local timeLeft = 120

local function drawTimeLeft()
  ui.text(string.format('Time left: %02.0f', math.max(0, timeLeft)))
  -- keep in mind: when timer would reach 0, block would still be visible for a bit while fading out, so
  -- that’s why there is that `math.max()` call
end

local fadingTimer = ui.FadingElement(drawTimeLeft)

function script.update(dt)
  timeLeft = timeLeft - dt
  fadingTimer(timeLeft > 0 and timeLeft < 60)  -- only show timer if time left is below 60 seconds
end
```

  Parameters:

  1. `drawCallback`: `fun()` Draw callback. Would only be called if alpha is above 0.2%, so there is no overhead if element is hidden.

  2. `initialState`: `boolean?` Should element be visible from the start. Default value: `false`.

  Returns:

  - `fun`
## Class ui.FileIcon
Helper for drawing file icons.

- `ui.FileIcon:style(style)`

  Set icon style.

  Parameters:

    1. `style`: `ui.FileIcon.Style`
## Class ui.DWriteFont
DirectWrite font name builder. Instead of using it, you can simply provide a string, but this thing might be a nicer way. You can chain its methods too:
```lua
local MyFavouriteFont = ui.DWriteFont('Best Font', './data'):weight(ui.DWriteFont.Weight.Bold):style(ui.DWriteFont.Style.Italic):stretch(ui.DWriteFont.Stretch.Condensed)
…
ui.pushFont(MyFavouriteFont)  -- you could also just put font here, but if defined once and reused, it would generate less garbage for GC to clean up.
ui.dwriteText('Hello world!', 14)
ui.popFont()
```

- `ui.DWriteFont:weight(weight)`

  Set font weight. Bold styles can be emulated even if there isn’t such font face, although quality of real font face would be better.

  Parameters:

    1. `weight`: `ui.DWriteFont.Weight|integer` Alternatively, could be an integer in 1…999 range.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ui.DWriteFont:style(style)`

  Set font style. Italic style can be emulated even if there isn’t such font face, although quality of real font face would be better.

  Parameters:

    1. `style`: `ui.DWriteFont.Style`

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ui.DWriteFont:stretch(stretch)`

  Set font stretch.

  Parameters:

    1. `stretch`: `ui.DWriteFont.Stretch`

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ui.DWriteFont:axis(key, value)`

  Set a custom axis value (available on Windows 10 Build 20348 or newer, otherwise values will be ignored).

  Parameters:

    1. `key`: `'weight'|'width'|'slant'|'opticalSize'|'italic'|string` Font variation table with list of keys is shown on https://fontdrop.info/.

    2. `value`: `number`

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ui.DWriteFont:allowRealSizes(allow)`

  Disable font size rounding. Please use carefully: if you would to animate font size, it would quickly generate way too many atlases
and increase both VRAM consumption and drawing time. If you need to animate font size, consider using `ui.beginScale()`/`ui.endScale()` instead.

  Parameters:

    1. `allow`: `boolean?` Default value: `true`.

  Returns:

    - `self`

- `ui.DWriteFont:allowEmoji(allow)`

  Allow or disallow use of colored emojis. If disabled, default black and white system glyphs will be drawn instead to system capabilities.

a HTML div with overflow set to either scrolling or hidden, for example.

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` Window ID, has to be unique within given context (like, two sub-windows of the same window should have different IDs).

## Function ui.treeNode(label, flags, content)
Draw a tree node element: a collapsible block with content inside it (which might include other tree
nodes). Great for grouping things together. Note: if you need to have a tree node with changing label,
use label like “your changing label###someUniqueID” for it to work properly. Everything after “###” will
count as ID and not be shown. Same trick applies to other controls as well, such as tabs, buttons, etc.

  Parameters:

  1. `label`: `string` Tree node label (which also acts like its ID).

  ui.tabItem('Tab 2', function () --[[ Contents of Tab 2 ]] end)
end)
```

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` Tab bar ID.

  3. `content`: `fun(): T?` Individual tabs callback.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ui.tabItem(label, flags, content, opened)
Draw a new tab in a tab bar. Note: if you need to have a tab with changing label,
use label like “your changing label###someUniqueID” for it to work properly. Everything after “###” will
count as ID and not be shown. Same trick applies to other controls as well, such as tree nodes, buttons, etc.
```lua
ui.tabBar('someTabBarID', function ()
  ui.tabItem('Tab 1', function () --[[ Contents of Tab 1 ]] end)
  ui.tabItem('Tab 2', function () --[[ Contents of Tab 2 ]] end)
end)
```

  Parameters:

  1. `label`: `string` Tab label.

  2. `flags`: `ui.TabItemFlags?` Tab flags.

  3. `content`: `fun(): T?` Tab content callback (called only if tab is selected).

  4. `opened`: `refbool?` Pass a `refbool` with `true` value here to show close button. When clicked, value in `refbool` will  be set to `false`.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ui.onImageReady(imageSource, callback)
Sets a callback that will be called when image is loaded. If image is already loaded, calls `callback` immediately, before
exiting the function.

Note: By default images from local files are loaded syncronously, use `ui.setAsynchronousImagesLoading(true)` function to change this behaviour.

  Parameters:

  1. `imageSource`: `ui.ImageSource` Path to the image, absolute or relative to script folder or AC root. URLs are also accepted.

  2. `callback`: `fun()` Callback to call once image is loaded.
## Function ui.itemPopup(id, mouseButton, content)
Adds context menu to previously drawn item which would open when certain mouse button would be pressed. Once it happens,
content callback will be called each frame to draw contents of said menu.
```lua
ui.itemPopup(ui.MouseButton.Right, function ()
  if ui.selectable('Item 1') then --[[ Item 1 was clicked ]] end
  if ui.selectable('Item 2') then --[[ Item 2 was clicked ]] end
  ui.separator()
  if ui.selectable('Item 3') then --[[ Item 3 was clicked ]] end
  -- Other types of controls would also work
end)
```

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` Context menu ID.

  2. `mouseButton`: `ui.MouseButton` Mouse button

  3. `content`: `fun(): T?` Menu content callback (called only if menu is opened).

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ui.combo(label, previewValue, flags, content)
Adds a dropdown list (aka combo box). Items are drawn in content callback function, or alternatively
it can work with a list of strings and an ID of a selected item, returning either ID of selected item and
boolean with `true` value if it was changed, or if ID is a refnumber, it would just return a boolean value
for whatever it was changed or not.

  Parameters:

  1. `label`: `string` Label of the element.

  2. `previewValue`: `string?` Preview value.

  3. `flags`: `ui.ComboFlags?` Combo box flags.

  4. `content`: `fun(): T?` Combo box items callback.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ui.slider(label, value, min, max, format, power)
Adds a slider. For value, either pass `refnumber` and slider would return a single boolean with `true` value
if it was moved (and storing updated value in passed `refnumber`), or pass a regular number and then
slider would return number and then a boolean. Example:
```lua
-- With refnumber:
local ref = refnumber(currentValue)
if ui.slider('Test', ref) then currentValue = ref.value end

-- Without refnumber:
local value, changed = ui.slider('Test', currentValue)
if changed then currentValue = value end

-- Or, of course, if you don’t need to know if it changed (and, you can always use `ui.itemEdited()` as well):
currentValue = ui.slider('Test', currentValue)
```
I personally prefer to hide slider label and instead use its format string to show what’s it for. IMGUI would
not show symbols after “##”, but use them for ID calculation.
```lua
currentValue = ui.slider('##someSliderID', currentValue, 0, 100, 'Quantity: %.0f')
```
By the way, a bit of clarification: “##” would do
that, but “###” would result in ID where only symbols going after “###” are taken into account. Helps if you
have a control which label is constantly changing. For example, a tab showing a number of elements or current time.

To enter value with keyboard, hold Ctrl and click on it.

  Parameters:

  1. `label`: `string` Slider label.

  2. `value`: `refnumber|number` Current slider value.

  3. `min`: `number?` Default value: 0.

  4. `max`: `number?` Default value: 1.

  5. `format`: `string|'%.3f'|nil` C-style format string. Default value: `'%.3f'`.

  6. `power`: `number|boolean|nil` Power for non-linear slider. Default value: `1` (linear). Pass `true` to enable integer mode instead.

  Returns:

  1. `number` Possibly updated slider value.

  2. `boolean` True if slider has moved.
## Function ui.drawRaceFlag(color)
Draws race flag of a certain type, or in a certain color in its usual position.
Use it if you want to add a new flag type: this way, if custom UI later would replace flags with
a different look (or even if it’s just a custom texture mod), it would still work.

Note: if your script can access physics and you need a regular flag, using `physics.overrideRacingFlag()`
would work better (it would also affect track conditions and such).

  Parameters:

  1. `color`: `ac.FlagType|rgbm`
## Function ui.drawCarIcon(iconID, color, hint)
Draws icon for car state, along with low fuel icon. If more than one icon is visible at once, subsequent ones are drawn
to the right of previous icon. Settings altering position and opacity of low fuel icon also apply here. Background is
included by default: simply pass a semi-transparent symbol here.

  Parameters:

  1. `iconID`: `ui.Icons|fun(iconSize: number)` Might be an icon ID or anything else `ui.icon()` can take, or a function taking icon size.

  2. `color`: `rgbm?` Icon tint for background. Default value: `rgbm.colors.white`.

  3. `hint`: `string?` Optional hint appearing if mouse is hovering the icon.
## Function ui.atlasIconID(filename, uv1, uv2)
Generates ID to use with `ui.icon()` to draw an icon from an atlas. Might be faster to safe the result
of the call and reuse that, although it’s not that expensive if you only need to render a couple of icons.

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `string` Texture filename.

  2. `uv1`: `number|vec2` UV coordinates of the upper left corner in 0…1 range, 0 for the top left corner.

  3. `uv2`: `number|vec2` UV coordinates of the bottom right corner in 0…1 range, 0 for the top left corner.

  Returns:

  - `ui.Icons` Returns an ID to be used as an argument for `ui.icon()` function.
## Function ui.atlasIcons(filename, columns, rows, icons)
Generates a table acting like icons atlas.

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `string` Texture filename.

  2. `columns`: `integer` Number of columns in the atlas.

  3. `rows`: `integer` Number of rows in the atlas.

  4. `icons`: `T` Table with icons from left top corner, each icon is a table with 1-based row and column indices.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ui.MediaPlayer.supported()
Checks if system supports these media players (Microsoft Media Foundation framework was added in Windows 8). If it’s not supported,
you can still use API, but it would fail to load any video or audio.

  Returns:

  - `boolean`
## Function ui.MediaPlayer(source, audioParams)
Media player which can load a video and be used as a texture in calls like `ui.drawImage()`, `ui.beginTextureShade()` or `display.image()`. Also, it can load an audio
file and play it offscreen.

Since 0.1.77, media players can also be used as textures for scene references, like `ac.findMeshes(…):setMaterialTexture()`.

Uses Microsoft Media Foundation framework for video decoding and hardware acceleration, so only supports codecs supported by Windows.
Instead of asking user to install custom codecs, it might be a better idea to use [ones available by default](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-faq-392483a0-b9ac-27c7-0f61-5a7f18d408af).

Usage:
```lua
local player = ui.MediaPlayer()
player:setSource('myVideo.wmw'):setAutoPlay(true)

function script.update(dt)
  ui.drawImage(player, vec2(), vec2(400, 200))
end
```

When first used, MMF library is loaded and a separate DirectX device is created. Usually this process is pretty much instantaneous,
but sometimes it might take a few seconds. During that time you can still use media player methods to set source, volume, start playback, etc.
Some things might act a bit differently though. To make sure library is loaded before use, you can use `ui.MediaPlayer.supportedAsync()` with
a callback.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|nil` URL or a filename. Optional, can be set later with `player:setSource()`.

  2. `audioParams`: `{rawOutput: boolean, reverbResponse: boolean, use3D: boolean, useOcclusion: boolean, insideConeAngle: number, outsideConeAngle: number, outsideVolume: number, minDistance: number, maxDistance: number, dopplerEffect: number}|nil|`{` reverbResponse = false, use3D = false }` "Table with properties:\n- `rawOutput` (`boolean`): Set to `true` to output audio directly, without FMOD (won’t respect AC audio device selection or stop when AC is paused).\n- `reverbResponse` (`boolean`): Set to `true` to get audio to react to reverb.\n- `use3D` (`boolean`): Set to `true` to load audio without any 3D effects (if not set, car display scripts have it as `true` by default and update position based on screen position, but only them).\n- `useOcclusion` (`boolean`): Set to `true` to let audio occlude based on track geometry (for configured tracks, 3D audio events only).\n- `insideConeAngle` (`number`): Angle in degrees at which audio is at 100% volume.\n- `outsideConeAngle` (`number`): Angle in degrees at which audio is at `outsideVolume` volume.\n- `outsideVolume` (`number`): Volume multiplier if listener is outside of the cone.\n- `minDistance` (`number`): Distance at which audio would stop going louder as it approaches listener (default is 1).\n- `maxDistance` (`number`): Distance at which audio would attenuating as it gets further away from listener (default is 10 km).\n- `dopplerEffect` (`number`): Scale for doppler effect."

  Returns:

  - `ui.MediaPlayer`

but sometimes it might take a few seconds. During that time you can still use media player methods to set source, volume, start playback, etc.
Some things might act a bit differently though. To make sure library is loaded before use, you can use `ui.MediaPlayer.supportedAsync()` with
a callback.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:audio()`

  Get an audio event corresponding with with media player. Disposing this one, as well as playback controls, won’t have any effect.

    1. `value`: `number?` New balance value from -1 (left channel only) to 1 (right channel only). Default value: 0.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:setMuted(value)`

  Sets muted parameter.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to disable audio.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:setLooping(value)`

  Sets looping parameter.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` if video needs to start from beginning when it ends.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:setAutoPlay(value)`

  Sets auto playing parameter.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` if video has to be started automatically.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:setGenerateMips(value)`

  Sets MIP maps generation flag. Use it if you want to tie media resource directly to a mesh instead of using it
in UI or scriptable display.

MIP maps are additional copies of the texture with half resolution, quarter resolution, etc. If in distance, GPUs
would read those downscaled copies instead of main texture to both avoid aliasing and improve performance.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to generate MIP maps.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:setUpdatePeriod(period)`

  If you’re using a video element in UI or a scriptable display, this method would not do anything. But if you’re
tying media to a mesh (with, for example, `ac.findMeshes():setMaterialTexture()`), this method allows to control
how much time is passed before video is updated to the next frame. Default value: 0.05 s for 20 FPS. Set to 0
to update video every frame (final framerate would still be limited by frame rate of original video).

  Parameters:

    1. `period`: `number?` Update period in seconds. Default value: 0.05.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:linkToSimulationSpeed(value)`

  Links playback rate to simulation speed: pauses when game or replay are paused, slows down with replay slow motion,
speeds up with replay fast forwarding.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to link playback rate.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:useAsTexture()`

  Sets media element to be used as texture by calling these functions:
```lua
self:setAutoPlay(true)            -- start playing once video is ready
self:setMuted(true)               -- without audio (it wouldn’t be proper 3D audio anyway)
self:setLooping(true)             -- start from the beginning once it ends
self:setGenerateMips(true)        -- generate MIPs to avoid aliasing in distance
self:linkToSimulationSpeed(true)  -- pause when game or replay are paused, etc.
```
Of course, you can call those functions manually, or call this one and then use any other functions
to change the behaviour. It’s only a helping shortcut, that’s all.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:play()`

  Starts to play a video.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:pause()`

  Pauses a video. To fully stop it, use `player:pause():setCurrentTime(0)`.

  Returns:

    - `ui.MediaPlayer` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.MediaPlayer:debugText()`

  Some debug information for testing and fixing things.

  Returns:

    - `string`
## Function ui.MediaPlayer.supported()
Checks if system supports these media players (Microsoft Media Foundation framework was added in Windows 8). If it’s not supported,
you can still use API, but it would fail to load any video or audio.

Instead of this one, use `ui.MediaPlayer.supportedAsync()` which wouldn’t cause game to freeze while waiting for MMF to finish
initializing.

  Returns:

  - `boolean`
## Function ui.MediaPlayer.supportedAsync(callback)
Checks if system supports these media players (Microsoft Media Foundation framework was added in Windows 8). If it’s not supported,
you can still use API, but it would fail to load any video or audio. Runs asyncronously.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(supported: boolean)`
## Function ui.ExtraCanvas(resolution, mips, antialiasingMode, textureFormat, flags)

  Parameters:

  1. `resolution`: `vec2|integer` Resolution in pixels. Usually textures with sizes of power of two work the best.

  2. `mips`: `integer?` Number of MIPs for a texture. MIPs are downsized versions of main texture used to avoid aliasing. Default value: 1 (no MIPs).

  3. `antialiasingMode`: `render.AntialiasingMode?` Antialiasing mode. Default value: `render.AntialiasingMode.None` (disabled).

  4. `textureFormat`: `render.TextureFormat?` Texture format. Default value: `render.TextureFormat.R8G8B8A8.UNorm`.

  5. `flags`: `render.TextureFlags?` Extra flags. Default value: `0`.

  Returns:

  - `ui.ExtraCanvas`
## Class ui.ExtraCanvas
Extra canvases are textures you can use in UI calls instead of filenames or apply as material textures to scene geometry,
and also edit them live by drawing things into them using “ui…” functions. A few possible use cases as an example:
- If your app or display uses a complex background or another element, it might be benefitial to draw it into a texture once and then reuse it;
- If you want to apply some advanced transformations to some graphics, it might work better to use texture;
- It can also be used to blur some elements by drawing them into a texture and then drawing it blurred.

Note: update happens from a different short-lived UI context, so interactive controls would not work here.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:dispose()`

  Disposes canvas and releases resources.
function _ui_ExtraCanvas:dispose() end

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:mip(index)`

  Return explicit MIP to use as an image. If called with index of 0, returns texture similar to main one, but only with a single MIP.

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 0-based MIP index.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:setName(name)`

  Sets canvas name for debugging. Canvases with set name appear in Lua Debug App, allowing to monitor their state.

  Parameters:

    1. `name`: `string?` Name to display texture as. If set to `nil` or `false`, name will be reset and texture will be hidden.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:update(callback)`

  Updates texture, calling `callback` to draw things with. If you want to do several changes, it would work better to group them in a
single `canvas:update()` call.

Note: canvas won’t be cleared here, to clear it first, use `canvas:clear()` method.

  Parameters:

    1. `callback`: `fun(dt: number)` Drawing function. Might not be called if canvas has been disposed or isn’t available for drawing into.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:updateWithShader(params)`

  Updates texture using a shadered quad. Faster than using `:update()` with `ui.renderShader()`:
no time will be wasted setting up IMGUI pass and preparing all that data, just a single draw call.
Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

  Parameters:

    1. `params`: `{p1: vec2, p2: vec2, uv1: vec2, uv2: vec2, mip: integer, blendMode: render.BlendMode, async: boolean, cacheKey: number, defines: table, textures: table, values: table, directValuesExchange: boolean, shader: string}|`{textures` = {}, values = {}, shader = 'float4 main(PS_IN pin) {return float4(pin.Tex.x, pin.Tex.y, 0, 1);}'}` "Table with properties:\n- `p1` (`vec2`): Position of upper left corner relative to whole screen or canvas. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `p2` (`vec2`): Position of bottom right corner relative to whole screen or canvas. Default value: size of canvas.\n- `uv1` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for upper left corner. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `uv2` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for bottom right corner. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `mip` (`integer`): 0-based index of target MIP layer. Default value: `0`. Use `:mip(index - 1)` as a texture input to access previous MIP view in case you want to generate new MIPs from previous ones. If this parameter is above 0, automatic MIPs generation stops.\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Blend mode. Default value: `render.BlendMode.Opaque`.\n- `async` (`boolean`): If set to `true`, drawing won’t occur until shader would be compiled in a different thread.\n- `cacheKey` (`number`): Optional cache key for compiled shader (caching will depend on shader source code, but not on included files, so make sure to change the key if included files have changed).\n- `defines` (`table`): Defines to pass to the shader, either boolean, numerical or string values (don’t forget to wrap complex expressions in brackets). False values won’t appear in code and true will be replaced with 1 so you could use `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` with them.\n- `textures` (`table`): Table with textures to pass to a shader. For textures, anything passable in `ui.image()` can be used (filename, remote URL, media element, extra canvas, etc.). If you don’t have a texture and need to reset bound one, use `false` for a texture value (instead of `nil`)\n- `values` (`table`): Table with values to pass to a shader. Values can be numbers, booleans, vectors, colors or 4×4 matrix. Values will be aligned automatically.\n- `directValuesExchange` (`boolean`): If you’re reusing table between calls instead of recreating it each time and pass `true` as this parameter, `values` table will be swapped with an FFI structure allowing to skip data copying step and achieve the best performance. Note: with this mode, you’ll have to transpose matrices manually.\n- `shader` (`string`): Shader code (format is HLSL, regular DirectX shader); actual code will be added into a template in “assettocorsa/extension/internal/shader-tpl/ui.fx”."

  Returns:

    - `boolean` Returns `false` if shader is not yet ready and no drawing occured (happens only if `async` is set to `true`).

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:updateSceneWithShader(params)`

  Updates texture using a shader with a fullscreen pass. Faster than using `:update()` with `ui.renderShader()`:
no time will be wasted setting up IMGUI pass and preparing all that data, just a single draw call.
Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

Unlike `:updateWithShader()`, this version is single pass stereo-aware and can be used in the middle of
rendering scene, and has access to camera state and some rendering pipeline textures by default (see “fullscreen.fx” template).
Use it if you need to prepare an offscreen buffer to apply to the scene.

  Parameters:

    1. `params`: `{p1: vec2, p2: vec2, uv1: vec2, uv2: vec2, mip: integer, blendMode: render.BlendMode, async: boolean, cacheKey: number, defines: table, textures: table, values: table, directValuesExchange: boolean, shader: string}|`{textures` = {}, values = {}, shader = 'float4 main(PS_IN pin) {return float4(pin.Tex.x, pin.Tex.y, 0, 1);}'}` "Table with properties:\n- `p1` (`vec2`): Position of upper left corner relative to whole screen or canvas.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` Returns `false` if shader is not yet ready and no drawing occured (happens only if `async` is set to `true`).

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:clear(col)`

  Clears canvas.

  Parameters:

    1. `col`: `rgbm?` Default value: `rgbm.colors.transparent`.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:applyAntialiasing()`

  Manually applies antialiasing to the texture (works only if it was created with a specific antialiasing mode).
By default antialiasing is applied automatically, but calling this function switches AA to a manual mode.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:mipsUpdate()`

  Generates MIPs. Once called, switches texture to manual MIPs generating mode. Note: this operation is not that expensive, but it’s not free.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:setExposure(value)`

  Overrides exposure used if antialiasing mode is set to YEBIS value. By default scene exposure is used.

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `number?` Exposure used by YEBIS post-processing. Pass `nil` to reset to default behavior.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:save(filename, format)`

  Saves canvas as an image.

  Parameters:

    1. `filename`: `string` Destination filename.

    2. `format`: `ac.ImageFormat|nil` Texture format (by default guessed based on texture name).

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:encode()`

  Returns image encoded in DDS format. Might be useful if you would need to store an image
in some custom form (if so, consider compressing it with `ac.compress()`).

Note: you can later use `ui.decodeImage()` to get a string which you can then pass as a texture name
to any of texture receiving functions. This way, you can load image into a new canvas later: just
create a new canvas (possibly using `ui.imageSize()` first to get image size) and update it drawing
imported image to the full size of the canvas.

  Returns:

    - `string|nil` Binary data, or `nil` if binary data export has failed.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:size()`

  Returns texture resolution (or zeroes if element has been disposed).

  Returns:

    - `vec2`

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:mips()`

  Returns number of MIP maps (1 for no MIP maps and it being a regular texture).

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:sharedHandle(crossProcess)`

  Returns shared handle to the texture. Shared handle can be used in other scripts with `ui.SharedTexture()`, or, if `crossProcess` flag
is set to `true`, also accessed by other processes.

  Parameters:

    1. `crossProcess`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to be able to pass a handle to other processes. Requires `render.TextureFlags.Shared` flag to be set during creation. Default value: `false`.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:clone()`

  Clones current canvas.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns new canvas.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:backup()`

  Backup current state of canvas, return a function which can be called to restore original state. Note:
it clones current canvas texture, so don’t make too many backup copies at once.

  Returns:

    - `fun`

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:copyFrom(other)`

  Copies contents from another canvas, CPU canvas data, image or an icon. Faster than copying by drawing. If source is disposed or missing,
does not alter the contents of the canvas.

  Parameters:

    1. `other`: `ui.ExtraCanvas|ui.ExtraCanvasData|ui.Icons` Canvas to copy content from.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:gaussianBlurFrom(other, kernelSize)`

  Fills with canvas with blurred version of another texture, applying two optimized gaussian blur passes.

  Parameters:

    1. `other`: `ui.ImageSource` Canvas to copy content from.

    2. `kernelSize`: `ui.GaussianBlurKernelSize?` Kernel size. Default value: 63.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvas:accessData(callback)`

  Downloads data from GPU to CPU asyncronously (usually takes about 0.15 ms to get the data). Resulting data can be
used to access colors of individual pixels or upload it back to CPU restoring original state.

  Parameters:

    1. `callback`: `fun(err: string, data: ui.ExtraCanvasData)`

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvas` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.
## Class ui.ExtraCanvasData
Contents of `ui.ExtraCanvas` copied to CPU. There, that data can no longer be used to draw things (but it can be uploaded
back to GPU with `canvas:copyFrom()`), but it can be used to quickly access colors of individual pixels. Unlike `ui.ExtraCanvas`,
instances of `ui.ExtraCanvasData` consume RAM, not VRAM.

To save RAM while storing several copies of data, you can use `data:compress()` to apply fast LZ4 compression. Note that each time
you would use data by reading colors of pixels, data would get decompressed automatically. Copying extra data back to canvas with
`canvas:copyFrom()` works with both compressed and decompressed data (data would be decompressed temporary).

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:dispose()`

  Disposes canvas and releases resources.
function _ui_ExtraCanvasData:dispose() end

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:compress()`

  Compresses data using LZ4 algorithm if data wasn’t compressed already.

  Returns:

    - `ui.ExtraCanvasData` Returns itself for chaining several methods together.

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:size()`

  Returns original texture resolution (or zeroes if data has been disposed).

  Returns:

    - `vec2`

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:compressed()`

  Returns `true` if data is currently compressed.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:memoryFootprint()`

  Returns space taken by data in bytes.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:floatValue(x, y)`

  Returns numeric value of a pixel of R32FLOAT texture. If coordinates are outside, or data has been disposed, returns zeroes.

  Parameters:

    1. `x`: `integer` 0-based X coordinate.

    2. `y`: `integer` 0-based Y coordinate.

  Returns:

    - `number` Pixel color from 0 to 1.

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:color(x, y)`

  Returns color of a pixel of RGBA8888 texture. If coordinates are outside, or data has been disposed, returns zeroes.

  Parameters:

    1. `x`: `integer` 0-based X coordinate.

    2. `y`: `integer` 0-based Y coordinate.

  Returns:

    - `rgbm` Pixel color from 0 to 1.

- `ui.ExtraCanvasData:colorTo(color, x, y)`

  Writes color of a pixel to a provided `rgbm` value. Same as `data:color()`, but does not create new color values, so should be
easier on garbage collector and more useful if you need to go through a lot of pixels for some reason.

  Parameters:

    1. `color`: `rgbm` 0-based X coordinate.

    2. `x`: `integer` 0-based X coordinate.

    3. `y`: `integer` 0-based Y coordinate.

    - `rgbm` Pixel color from 0 to 1 (same as input `color`).
## Function ui.shortcut(key, ...)

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `{key: ui.KeyIndex, ctrl: boolean, alt: boolean, shift: boolean, super: boolean}|`{` key = ui.KeyIndex.A, ctrl = false }`

  Returns:

  - `fun`
## Function ui.renderTexture(params)
Draws image using custom drawcall (not an IMGUI drawcall). Any transformations and color shifts
wouldn’t work. But there are some extra shading features available here.

  Parameters:

  1. `params`: `{filename: string, p1: vec2, p2: vec2, color: rgbm, colorOffset: rgbm, uv1: vec2, uv2: vec2, blendMode: render.BlendMode, mask1: string, mask1UV1: vec2, mask1UV2: vec2, mask1Flags: render.TextureMaskFlags, mask2: string, mask2UV1: vec2, mask2UV2: vec2, mask2Flags: render.TextureMaskFlags}|`{filename` = '', p1 = vec2(0, 0), p2 = vec2(1, 1), color = rgbm.colors.white, uv1 = vec2(0, 0), uv2 = vec2(1, 1), blendMode = render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate}` "Table with properties:\n- `filename` (`string`): Path to the image, absolute or relative to script folder or AC root. URLs are also accepted.\n- `p1` (`vec2`): Position of upper left corner relative to whole screen or canvas.\n- `p2` (`vec2`): Position of bottom right corner relative to whole screen or canvas.\n- `color` (`rgbm`): Tint of the image, with white it would be drawn as it is. In this call, can be above 0. Default value: `rgbm.colors.white`.\n- `colorOffset` (`rgbm`): Color offset. Default value: `rgbm.colors.transparent`.\n- `uv1` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for upper left corner. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `uv2` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for bottom right corner. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Blend mode.

Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `mask1UV2` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for bottom right corner of a mask. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `mask1Flags` (`render.TextureMaskFlags`): Flags for the first mask. Default value: 6.\n- `mask2` (`string`): Optional mask #2, resulting image will be drawn only if mask is non-transparent and with non-zero alpha channel. Default value: `nil`.\n- `mask2UV1` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for upper left corner of a mask. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `mask2UV2` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for bottom right corner of a mask. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `mask2Flags` (`render.TextureMaskFlags`): Flags for the second mask. Default value: 6."
## Function ui.renderShader(params)
Draws a quad with a custom shader. Shader is compiled at first run, which might take a few milliseconds.
If you’re drawing things continuously, use `async` parameter and shader will be compiled in a separate thread,
while drawing will be skipped until shader is ready.

You can bind up to 32 textures and pass any number/boolean/vector/color/matrix values to the shader, which makes
it a very effective tool for any custom drawing you might need to make.

Example:
```lua
ui.renderShader({
  async = true,
  p1 = vec2(),
  p2 = ui.windowSize(),
  blendMode = render.BlendMode.BlendAdd,
  textures = {
    txInput1 = 'texture.png',  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “tx”
    txInput2 = mediaPlayer,
    txMissing = false
  },
  values = {
    gValueColor = rgbm(1, 2, 0, 0.5),  -- any key would work, but it’s easier to have a common prefix like “g”
    gValueNumber = math.random(),
    gValueVec = vec2(1, 2),
    gFlag = math.random() > 0.5
  },
  shader = [[
    float4 main(PS_IN pin) {
      float4 in1 = txInput1.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex);
      float4 in2 = txInput2.Sample(samAnisotropic, pin.Tex + gValueVec);
      return gFlag ? in1 + in2 * gValueColor : in2;
    }
  ]]
})
```

Tip: to simplify and speed things up, it might make sense to move table outside of a function to reuse it from frame
to frame, simply accessing and updating textures, values and other parameters before call. However, make sure not to
add new textures and values, otherwise it would require to recompile shader and might lead to VRAM leaks (if you would
end up having thousands of no more used shaders). If you don’t have a working texture at the time of first creating
that table, use `false` for missing texture value.

Note: if shader would fail to compile, a C++ exception will be triggered, terminating script completely (to prevent AC
from crashing, C++ exceptions halt Lua script that triggered them until script gets a full reload).

  Parameters:

  1. `params`: `{p1: vec2, p2: vec2, uv1: vec2, uv2: vec2, blendMode: render.BlendMode, async: boolean, cacheKey: number, defines: table, textures: table, values: table, directValuesExchange: boolean, shader: string}|`{p1` = vec2(0, 0), p2 = vec2(1, 1), blendMode = render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate, textures = {}, values = {}, shader = 'float4 main(PS_IN pin) {return float4(pin.Tex.x, pin.Tex.y, 0, 1);}'}` "Table with properties:\n- `p1` (`vec2`): Position of upper left corner relative to whole screen or canvas.\n- `p2` (`vec2`): Position of bottom right corner relative to whole screen or canvas.\n- `uv1` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for upper left corner. Default value: `vec2(0, 0)`.\n- `uv2` (`vec2`): Texture coordinates for bottom right corner. Default value: `vec2(1, 1)`.\n- `blendMode` (`render.BlendMode`): Blend mode. Default value: `render.BlendMode.BlendAccurate`.\n- `async` (`boolean`): If set to `true`, drawing won’t occur until shader would be compiled in a different thread.\n- `cacheKey` (`number`): Optional cache key for compiled shader (caching will depend on shader source code, but not on included files, so make sure to change the key if included files have changed).\n- `defines` (`table`): Defines to pass to the shader, either boolean, numerical or string values (don’t forget to wrap complex expressions in brackets). False values won’t appear in code and true will be replaced with 1 so you could use `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` with them.\n- `textures` (`table`): Table with textures to pass to a shader. For textures, anything passable in `ui.image()` can be used (filename, remote URL, media element, extra canvas, etc.). If you don’t have a texture and need to reset bound one, use `false` for a texture value (instead of `nil`)\n- `values` (`table`): Table with values to pass to a shader. Values can be numbers, booleans, vectors, colors or 4×4 matrix. Values will be aligned automatically.\n- `directValuesExchange` (`boolean`): If you’re reusing table between calls instead of recreating it each time and pass `true` as this parameter, `values` table will be swapped with an FFI structure allowing to skip data copying step and achieve the best performance. Note: with this mode, you’ll have to transpose matrices manually.\n- `shader` (`string`): Shader code (format is HLSL, regular DirectX shader); actual code will be added into a template in “assettocorsa/extension/internal/shader-tpl/ui.fx”."

  Returns:

  - `boolean` Returns `false` if shader is not yet ready and no drawing occured (happens only if `async` is set to `true`).

# Module common/ac_extras_binaryinput.lua

## Function ac.ControlButton(id, defaults)

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` Name of a section in “controls.ini”. If you are adding a new input, use something like “your.namespace/Nice Name” (without square brackets or colons) to ensure there won’t be collisions and it would integrate nicely.

  2. `defaults`: `{keyboard: nil|{key: ui.KeyIndex?, ctrl: boolean?, shift: boolean?, alt: boolean?}, gamepad: nil|ac.GamepadButton, period: nil|number, hold: nil|boolean}?` Default settings if user has not configured input yet. Parameter `period` can be used to create buttons which would keep reporting as pressed (or call `:onDown()`) while held, can be configured in “controls.ini” as “REPEAT_PERIOD”; by default repeating is disable. Set parameter `hold` to a boolean value and control widget will get a “hold” switch. Buttons configured in “hold” mode return `true` on `:pressed()` when both pressed and released, as well as trigger `:onPressed()` when released too. Note: if `ac.ControlButton()` is called multiple times within a race session, only defaults from the first run will be taken into account (but if subsequent calls will have a “hold” value, button editing widget will still get a “hold” switch).

  Returns:

  - `ac.ControlButton`
## Class ac.ControlButton
A good way to listen to user pressing buttons configured in AC control settings. Handles everything for you automatically, and if you’re working
on a Lua app has a `:control()` method drawing a button showing current binding and allowing to change it in-game.

Could be used for original AC button bindings, new bindings added by CSP, or even for creating custom bindings. For that, make sure to pass a
reliably unique ID when creating a control button, maybe even prefixed by your app name.

Note: inputs for car scripts (both display and physics ones) would work only if the car is currently controlled by the user and not in a replay.
When possible, consider binding to car state instead. If your script runs at lower rate than graphics thread (skipping frames), either use `:down()`
or, better yet, sign to events, `:pressed()` call might return `false`.

when this method is called, callback will be called the next frame.

  Parameters:

    1. `callback`: `fun()`

  Returns:

    - `ac.Disposable`

## Function ac.setColorCorrection(targetLDR, priority)
YEBIS uses color matrices to quickly adjust HDR (input 0…∞ range) and LDR (output 0…1 range) color. Tweaks such as saturation, brightness and
contrast configured in YEBIS PP filter, or in video settings, all control those matrices.

This function allows to easily tweak those matrices. Call it, optionally specifying target matrix and priority, and then use methods of returned
entity to easily tweak the color. Chain methods together to achieve the desired effect:
```lua
ac.setColorCorrection():brightness(3):saturation(2)
```

Won’t have any effect if YEBIS is disabled, or if WeatherFX style script replaces YEBIS post-processing and doesn’t read
HDR matrix correctly. For compatibility reasons, if WeatherFX style script doesn’t read LDR color matrix, it will be applied
afterwards (in CSPs before 0.2.5, there wasn’t a method for WeatherFX style scripts to even access LDR color matrix, and
Assetto Corsa didn’t alter it at all).

Each time the function is called with the same target and priority parameters, its state will reset. Feel free to call this function every frame
if you want for adjustments to transition smoothly, or just once if you just want to tweak the colors and forget about it.

Note: you can keep a reference to returned value and tweak it instead, but then you’ll have to call `:reset()` manually. One tweak entity can
hold up to 40 adjustments, mostly to make sure it’s used correctly. Actual adjustments are very cheap.

Note: some scripts, such as online scripts, can access old API for color corrections, such as `ac.ColorCorrectionBrightness()`.
Those things are obsolete now, please use this thing instead (with only exception being WeatherFX styles, those could still
old API since it could be a tiny bit faster overall).

  Parameters:

  1. `targetLDR`: `boolean?` Set to `true` to alter final LDR image instead of original HDR image. Note: original AC never tweaked LDR color matrix at all. Default value: `false`.

  2. `priority`: `integer?` Specifies order of execution. Higher numbers mean corrections will apply first. Can be an integer in -100…100 range. Default value: `0`.

  Returns:

  - `ac.ColorCorrection`
